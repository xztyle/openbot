# Privacy

OpenBot is local-first, but it is not offline-only. Agent workspaces, conversations, attachments,
browser data, and team data stay on the computer that runs OpenBot. The optional OpenBot account
service stores the minimum central data needed for email sign-in, account avatars, remote host
configuration, memberships, invitations, and logical sessions.

The optional browser client at `/app` connects to the computer that runs OpenBot. Conversation
and attachment data travel through the existing encrypted host connection, not through the
account Worker. The browser keeps chat pages, drafts, search results, and file previews in memory;
it does not create a persistent offline chat cache. Files that the user downloads are saved by
their browser. The host must stay online. An owner or admin can manage members and invitations from
the browser; these requests go to the account Worker, as they do from the desktop app. A signed-in
user can also change the display name and avatar and disconnect account sessions from the browser;
these requests and the avatar image go to the same account Worker as from the desktop app. Host
settings, such as MCP servers and the server's hosted sites, travel through the encrypted host
connection. A hosted site belongs to the server that published it. When the computer that runs
OpenBot is a registered server, its site requests to the account Worker also send that server's id and
machine token. The account Worker already holds both, and uses them only to find the server and its
plan's site limit.
A Grok Bot export that a member imports into a joined server, from the desktop app or the browser, goes
to the computer that runs that server through the same encrypted host connection, not through the
account Worker. The host keeps the file only until the import ends, is cancelled, or expires.
To show each server's state, the browser also keeps a status connection to each host of the account
that no tab has open, as the mobile app does; the host then shows the member as present. Host logos
come from the account Worker to members of the host, and the browser can cache them.

Browser email sign-in uses a persistent host-only `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie.
Browser JavaScript cannot read the account credential. Trusted host public keys are stored in
local storage separately for each account. The shared file preview can also store its panel width.
The sidebar stores pinned agent and channel ids, collapsed section ids, and the selected channel id
for each account and host. The server rail stores the order of host ids for each account. The
browser also stores the chosen interface language and whether the completion sound is on. It stores
no message content.
Signing out revokes that credential's remote sessions and tells other open tabs to clear private
state. Host identity pins remain so a later sign-in cannot silently trust a replacement host key.
The web client adds no chat or account analytics events. It does not send email codes, credentials,
message content, file content, or search queries to telemetry.

Production builds of OpenBot desktop, the configured mobile app, and the website use a self-hosted OpenPanel service for product
analytics. Development builds, previews, tests, and Storybook do not send analytics.

The production account service also sends OpenPanel an event when a paid plan or a hosted server
changes: a Checkout starts or expires, a plan starts, changes, is cancelled or ends, a payment
succeeds or fails, the Customer Portal opens, or a hosted server is set up, fails to set up, stops
after no use, starts, changes its machine, stops at the end of its plan, is renewed or is deleted.
Each event has your account ID and only fixed values: the action, the plan, the billing period, the
currency, the amount that Stripe reports, the server size, the start reason and an error code. It has
no email, name, Stripe ID or server ID. The desktop analytics setting does not stop these events,
because the account service sends them and not your computer.

## Agent and host usage

The Usage view stores numeric token counts, activity counts, provider and model identifiers,
internal session and turn identifiers, timestamps, and cost estimates in the host's local SQLite
database. Collection starts when this feature is installed. It does not import old provider
transcripts or store message contents, credentials, or raw provider responses in analytics records.

Authenticated members of a host team can read aggregate usage for that host's agents through the
Team API, including from mobile. Desktop can also show the combined totals for all agents on one
host, with an optional agent filter. A host-wide response carries the combined totals, one row per
day, one row per model, one aggregate row per agent, identified by the agent's internal id, and one
row per day and provider with that provider's token count and cost estimate for the day. Agent
names are not part of the analytics payload; the client shows them from the agent list it already
reads. These records are separate from product analytics and are not sent
to OpenPanel or stored by the account service or Signal service. Conversation clearing retains usage;
agent deletion removes it. A duplicate agent starts with no usage history.

Authenticated members of a host team can also see that host's storage through the Team API: how
much disk space each location, agent and chat uses, and the name, size, type, date and chat title of
each sent or generated file. The response contains no file paths, and workspace and download files
are counted only as totals. Only owners and admins can delete a file or clear caches and logs. A
deleted file is removed from the host's disk; the message that sent it stays and shows that the file
is not available.

Costs are API-equivalent estimates in USD, not subscription charges. Missing usage, unknown prices,
and incomplete billing inputs remain marked as unavailable or partial.

## Product analytics

The production website records anonymous page views using only fixed paths: `/`, `/join`, the
download pages, the news and guide indexes, and published articles. It also records download clicks,
clicks on allowlisted public links, invitation validity, and open-app actions on invitation pages.
The production desktop app records application, sign-in, onboarding, agent, message, turn, prompt,
approval, queue, routine, team, browser, search, Remote Desktop, update, marketplace, memory,
provider, voice transcription, reaction, maintenance, Hosted Site, and confirmed
application-version-change actions. Event properties are limited to metadata such as counts, result
states, timing, provider, model, reasoning effort, application version, operating system, and coarse
failure codes.

The configured production mobile app records app opens and foreground returns, sign-in QR pairing
and camera-permission outcomes, host connection attempts and losses, conversation-load outcomes,
message and prompt-answer submissions, attachment operations, agent/routine/memory actions,
server selection/join/leave, search result counts, pin/unpin, hide/unhide, Usage views and sign-out.
Mobile properties include app version/build, iOS or Android, result, timing, bounded connection stage,
counts, coarse attachment size buckets, and provider/model/reasoning metadata where available.
Mobile never sends scanned QR values, install-referrer URLs or route identifiers. It does not
emit host lifecycle events again. Agent/host token and cost reports remain separate local data.

Analytics events do not contain message or direct-message text, prompts, replies, generated content,
search queries, embedded-browser URLs, paths or page titles, file names, local paths, commands, raw
error messages, or local identifiers for agents, threads, turns, messages, servers, and team members.
Website page views carry the five standard campaign tags `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`,
`utm_content`, and `utm_term` when a visitor arrives through a campaign link. Each tag is sent only
as a lowercase label of at most 64 characters made of letters, digits, dots, hyphens, and
underscores; any other value is dropped rather than shortened. No other query parameter, hash, or
invitation value is sent. Session replay and automatic interaction capture are disabled.

When a user signs in, OpenPanel receives the OpenBot account ID and normalized account email so UI
actions can be associated with the account that started them. The email is stored on the OpenPanel
profile and is not copied into individual event properties. Agent lifecycle events are emitted once
by the local host and associated with the host owner's account; clients that observe a remote host do
not emit the lifecycle again. Sign-in attempts and website activity remain anonymous until an account
has been verified. Landing-page attribution includes an allowlisted source category, an allowlisted
platform name (or unknown), and the referring domain when available. A recognized utm_source tag
takes precedence over the referring domain for platform classification; unrecognized tags are not
sent. Attribution excludes referrer paths, query parameters, fragments, credentials, ports, and
campaign URLs other than the allowlisted tags described above. Website page and article events carry
the path of a news article, guide or comparison published on openbot.run, together with the collection name, the
reading position reached (start, half, or end), and the section of the page a link was clicked in.
That path is a published article address and nothing else: it is matched against the site's own list
of articles, so no other part of a visited URL can be reported through it. Reading position is taken
from where the article sits on screen, never from how long it was open. Referrals from openbot.run and its subdomains are omitted. OpenPanel can also derive
session, device, browser, operating-system, network, and approximate geographic metadata from a
request. The analytics service runs on OpenBot's self-hosted infrastructure and receives events
through `analytics.openbot.run`.
Analytics is enabled in production by default. Desktop users can disable it under **Settings →
General → Privacy → Share product analytics**. A self-hosted server or Docker container has no
settings window. Its owner turns analytics off with `OPENBOT_ANALYTICS=off` (or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`) in the
environment, which holds for the whole run, or with `openbot analytics off`, which saves the same
choice as the setting. The preference is stored locally and disables both UI
analytics and lifecycle analytics emitted by the local host. Website analytics does not use the
desktop preference. Mobile has its own phone-wide **Settings → Privacy → Share product analytics**
preference, independent of desktop and host collection. It defaults to enabled in a
configured production build, is read before collection starts, and remains disabled if the stored
preference cannot be read. Disabling it drops pending mobile events; it does not remove previously
received events or retract an in-flight request. There is no persistent offline analytics queue.
Development and preview mobile builds do not collect product analytics. Mobile sign-in uses the
same account ID and normalized email profile traits described above. Before mobile sign-in, up to
100 sanitized events stay in process memory for at most 30 minutes from the first buffered event.
They are sent once with their original timestamps after an account becomes available. Opt-out,
expiry, and process exit discard unclaimed events. The oldest event is removed when the buffer is
full. Sign-out ends the old account's operation scopes; later signed-out activity can be associated
with the next account that signs in. No anonymous mobile event is sent before that association.

The local host also records how the agents are used:

- **Websites.** When a page in the embedded browser reaches a new registrable domain, the host sends
  that domain (for example `linkedin.com` for `www.linkedin.com`) and whether the user or an agent
  opened it. It never sends the subdomain, path, query, fragment or page title. A subdomain under a
  shared suffix is reduced to that suffix, so `user.github.io` is sent as `github.io`. IP addresses,
  single-label names, `localhost`, and names with no public suffix (for example `.local`, `.lan`,
  `.internal` or `.home.arpa`) are not sent.
- **Tools.** When a turn completes, the host sends one count per kind of tool the agent used (for
  example command, file change, web search, browser, or MCP), how many of those calls failed (Claude
  does not report failed tool calls, so its count is 0), and
  the plugin: the slug of an OpenBot catalog plugin, `builtin` for OpenBot's own tools, or `custom`.
  The tool name is sent only for OpenBot's own tools and catalog plugins. The name, address and
  command of a server the user added, the tool arguments and the tool results are not sent.
- **Routine runs.** The host sends the outcome of a routine run, whether it was scheduled or manual,
  and its schedule type (for example daily or weekly). The routine name and instruction are not
  sent.
- **Setup.** At most once a day, the host sends counts of agents, enabled routines, custom MCP
  servers, local skills and community skills; the slugs of enabled catalog plugins and of curated
  skills and agents; the providers in use; and whether Computer Use is enabled.
- **Agent source.** Turn events say whether the agent came from a curated listing, a community
  listing, or neither, and name only a curated listing. Marketplace events name only a curated
  skill, agent or catalog plugin.

Hosted Site analytics records only the operation, entry point, result, and bounded failure code. It
does not contain the site's URL, hostname, title, source path, site ID, or content. A one-time
backfill may update the email trait of an existing OpenPanel profile matched to a current account; it
does not create profiles for accounts without existing analytics activity.

OpenPanel event and profile data has no automatic retention limit. It remains stored until it is
removed manually or the analytics project is deleted. OpenPanel analytics does not change where
agent workspaces, conversations, attachments, browser data, and team data are stored.

## Data stored by the central account service

The account service runs on Cloudflare Workers. It uses Cloudflare D1 for structured records and
Cloudflare R2 for account avatar files.

The service stores:

- an account ID, normalized email address, identity key, optional name, optional avatar URL, and
  creation and update times;
- email sign-in challenges with the email address, hashes of the challenge ID, one-time code, and
  source IP address, attempt counts, and lifecycle times;
- account sessions with a session ID, account ID, token hash, creation time, last-use time,
  expiration time, and optional revocation time;
- rate-limit keys as hashes, their fixed window start time, and the attempt count;
- short-lived team authentication tickets with a ticket hash, account ID, team server ID, lifecycle
  times, and optional consumption time;
- remote host records with the owner, name, optional logo, device public key, and authorization epoch;
- remote memberships and invitations with roles, states, hashed invitation tokens, and lifecycle times;
- logical remote session records with the account, host, originating account-session hash, start,
  end, and expiration times;
- the current account avatar file and its content type when the user uploads an avatar.
- optional host logo files and their content types when the owner uploads a logo.
- webhook routes: for each webhook routine of a host, the opaque route ID, the host ID, the owner
  account ID, the link time, and the revocation time. When the routine stops using a route, or the
  host is deleted, the service sets the revocation time and the route stops working. The service
  keeps the row with these fields permanently, so that the old public URL never belongs to another
  host. It does not store the routine, the secret, or request bodies.
- published agent templates: the agent name, title, instructions, avatar, routine names, schedules
  and instructions, marketplace skill references, the `SKILL.md` text of local skills, the local
  agent ID, a share card image made from these fields, and creation and update times. Anyone
  with the link can read a template, and sites such as X show the share card when the link is
  posted. Unpublish removes the template content and its images. The service keeps the link ID,
  the account ID, the local agent ID and the unpublish time, so publishing the same agent again
  gives back the same link. Deleting the account removes them. Templates do not include
  workspace files, memories, conversations, or integration credentials.
- billing records when the account starts a paid plan: the Stripe customer ID, and for
  each subscription the Stripe subscription ID, plan, billing period, currency, price, status, period end,
  and whether it ends at the period end. The service also keeps the ID, type and receive time of each
  Stripe webhook event for 7 days, to ignore a repeated event. These records hold no card data.

The service does not store plaintext one-time codes, account session tokens, or team authentication
tickets in D1. It returns a new plaintext secret only to the client that requested it. The desktop
app encrypts its account session token with the operating-system storage protection before it writes
the token to disk.

The desktop app also keeps, for each joined server, the ID of its logical remote session and the
Signal address, so that the next start asks only for a new ticket. The file
(`openbot-remote-sessions-v1.bin`) is encrypted with the same storage protection and is not written
when that protection is unavailable. It names only the account that signed in. A session ID gives no
access without that account's session token. The app removes the file at sign-out or when another
account signs in, when it starts with no account signed in, and forgets a server's session when it
disconnects from the server or removes it. When the app quits, the session stays open in the account
service for the next start; signing out or disconnecting the device's sign-in ends it, as before.
Settings → General → Fast connection to servers turns this off. Off, the app removes the file at
once, keeps nothing on disk, and ends each session when it quits. Turned on during a run, it keeps the
sessions that are open at that time. The setting is on by default and is stored
in `openbot-remote-session-reuse-preference-v1.json`.

Account avatar URLs are public, long-lived resources. A person who has the complete URL can request
the avatar without an account session.

## Hosted servers

Each account can buy hosted servers. A hosted server is a Linux
OpenBot computer that runs in a [boat](https://boat.dev) sandbox in the EU (Germany, Finland or
France). The sandbox holds the server's workspaces, conversations, attachments, browser data and
team data, the same as your own computer would. The server stops 15 to 30 minutes after its last use and
starts again when you press a key or click in an app that shows it, or a few minutes before its next
scheduled routine run. Use means that an agent works, a remote desktop is open, a file moves, or you
sent a message, made a change, typed or used a shared browser view in the last 5 minutes. An app
that is only open does not count.
To show whether a server is asleep, the app asks the account service for its state. This request
stores nothing. When boat stops the sandbox, boat keeps a snapshot of its disk until
the server starts again. Deleting the server
deletes the sandbox. A hosted server updates itself: it downloads the newest release from GitHub
Releases, as an installed build does, installs the Ubuntu packages that the release needs from the
Ubuntu package servers, and starts it at its next start, or when a member with update access installs
it from Server Settings.

For each hosted server, the account service stores the owner, name, size and the size of a pending
plan change, the plan, billing interval and currency, the open Stripe Checkout session ID, desired
and reported state, a reason code when the server fails to start, the reason for its last start, the
boat sandbox ID, a hash of the setup claim with its expiry and first-use times, the ID of the account
session that the server signed in with, the time of its last use, the end of its boat stop timer, the time of
its next scheduled routine run (not the routine or its instructions), and creation, update and deletion times. After a
server is deleted, its record stays so that the service never loses track of a sandbox. It also
stores the ID and receive time of each boat webhook delivery for 7 days. The account service does
not receive the server's conversations, files or commands, and its boat key cannot read them.

The account service gives each sandbox a name in boat, so that an operator can find a server in the
boat dashboard: `openbot-`, the plan, your account email with each other character as `-`, and the
first 8 characters of the server ID, such as `openbot-starter-ada-example-com-1a2b3c4d`. boat keeps
the name with the sandbox.

## Central data retention

Cloudflare runs a maintenance task once each day. The task removes:

- sign-in challenges after they expire or are consumed;
- account sessions after they are revoked (older already-expired sessions are also removed);
- team authentication tickets after they expire or are consumed;
- rate-limit records after their 15-minute window ends.

These technical records are normally removed within 24 hours after they become inactive. A failed
maintenance run can keep them until a later successful run. The task logs only aggregate deletion
counts. It does not log account IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, tokens, or ticket values.

Replacing or deleting an account avatar or host logo removes the previous R2 object on a best-effort
basis. Account/device sessions and logical remote sessions deliberately have no time-based expiration.
Logout or device revocation ends access; removing a team membership ends access to that team.
Revoking an account/device credential disconnects its active remote sessions, without disconnecting
other authorized devices. Older remote sessions without a device binding are disconnected account-wide
on revocation. Short-lived QR codes and connection tickets still expire.
Settings → Profile → Account sessions lets you list and disconnect other desktop or mobile sign-ins.
Only device/session labels, IDs, sign-in times and last-activity times are returned, never credentials.
Mobile Settings can update your account name and photo through the same account API and list or
disconnect account sessions. The appearance preference is stored only on the phone.
After a profile change, the account API sends Signal a signed notification identifying the account.
Signal notifies only that account’s connected devices, without including the profile or credentials.
Devices check the profile and joined-server directory on a cold launch and every 15 minutes while active.
Returning from the background does not trigger an automatic check. On mobile, Notification Center and
other iOS `inactive` transitions do not count as leaving the app and do not reset the timer. Profile change notifications
can trigger an earlier refresh. These authenticated requests retrieve
account identity (name, email and avatar URL), not conversations or workspace content.

Mobile hidden and pinned chat preferences are stored on the phone, separately per account and server.
Conversation read/unread changes are stored on the desktop host and shared with your other connected devices.

The mobile app keeps a support log of up to 1,000 events in the phone's system cache: app version,
system and device model, app state changes, connection steps with server IDs and error text, the
desktop app version and protocol support of each server, the method, address without query, status
and time of its requests, including Team API requests to the desktop, and app warnings and errors. It
does not record message text, files, request bodies or headers, and it masks tokens, keys and email
addresses. The app never sends the log. **Settings → Support** shows it and lets you save the file or
clear it.

Mobile chat uses a local symbol beside links. It does not fetch website icons or Markdown images
when displaying a conversation. Link destinations are contacted only when you choose to open them.

Mobile chat can send selected files to the conversation's desktop host through the existing encrypted
team connection. Text pasted into the input is processed only after the user pastes it. A text paste
longer than 4,000 characters becomes a text attachment. Selected documents can also have a temporary
copy in the phone's system cache. Attachments added while editing a queued message are saved in the
phone's app document storage, with references in the saved edit, so they survive an app restart.
Those draft copies are removed when the attachment is removed or the edit is saved or cancelled.
Uploads are limited to 10 MB per file on mobile; successful uploads
become managed attachments on the host. Camera capture uses an in-chat preview. Photo selection uses the phone's system interface.
Image attachment previews are downloaded from the desktop host through the same encrypted connection.
Other attachments are downloaded when you choose Open or save. The phone creates a temporary file for
the system share sheet and removes it when that sheet closes. The app you select can keep its own copy.
Cloudflare account storage does not receive these files.

Mobile dictation uses the phone's speech recognition only after you press the microphone. It asks
for on-device recognition. On iOS, this applies when the phone supports it for your language. On
Android, it applies when the language model is installed. Otherwise, or when on-device recognition
fails before it recognizes any speech, the phone's recognition service, Apple or Google, receives the
audio. The recognized text goes into the message field and is sent
only when you send the message. OpenBot does not store or send the audio.

## Email delivery and infrastructure providers

OpenBot sends sign-in and team invitation messages through the configured SMTP provider. The
provider receives the recipient address and the message content. A sign-in message contains the
one-time code and its expiration time. A team invitation can contain the inviter address, team name,
role, and invite URL. The HTML version of a message loads the OpenBot logo from `openbot.run` when
the mail client shows images. The image address is the same in every message and identifies no
recipient.

Cloudflare processes account and configuration API requests. It does not carry Team API, file,
message, command, Remote Desktop media, or Remote Desktop input traffic. It forwards sealed iPhone
Live Activity updates that it cannot read; see [iPhone Live Activity](#iphone-live-activity). For an
agent's Slack app, it exchanges the Slack sign-in and serves the install page; see
[Slack connections](#slack-connections). It does the same for the Discord app; see
[Discord connections](#discord-connections). For the OpenBot Telegram bot, it records which
computer answers each chat; see [Telegram connections](#telegram-connections). Cloudflare and the
email provider can keep their own security, delivery, and network logs under their own policies. These provider logs are outside the
OpenBot application database and its daily maintenance task.

Paid server plans use Stripe. You enter card and billing details on Stripe's pages, not in OpenBot.
Stripe sends the account service the subscription state, the plan, its price, the period, and the
account and server IDs that the subscription names, never the card number. When you choose a plan
for a new hosted server, the account service sends Stripe your account email and account ID (to
make the Stripe customer), and the server ID, the plan, the billing period and the currency (to
open Stripe Checkout, `checkout.stripe.com`). When you delete a hosted server, the account service
tells Stripe to cancel its plan. When you manage billing,
the account service sends Stripe your Stripe customer ID, and the subscription ID of the plan you
change or cancel, to open the Stripe Customer Portal (`billing.stripe.com`). Stripe keeps the
customer, invoices and payment records under its own policy, also after the subscription ends.
Billing is off, and Stripe receives nothing, when the account service has no Stripe key.

## Data stored on the OpenBot computer

- `~/OpenBot/Agents` contains one workspace per agent. A profile written by a release before the
  bot-to-agent rename holds them under `~/OpenBot/Bots`; the application moves them on first launch.
- `~/OpenBot/Shared` contains managed transfers shared between agents, and
  `~/OpenBot/Shared/Data/agent-data.db` holds the records the agents keep for themselves between tasks.
  Every agent on this computer can read and write every table in that file, and the user can delete any
  table in agent settings.
- `~/OpenBot/Downloads` contains files downloaded by the embedded browser.
- `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot` contains the OpenBot SQLite database, agent metadata,
  conversations, message queues, direct messages, reactions, read state, attachment drafts and
  indexes, team configuration, local team members and sessions, the shared browser profile, cookies,
  application preferences, and the provider CLIs OpenBot downloads. The downloaded CLIs are kept in
  one store for the whole computer, which no other profile data shares.
- The local team configuration contains team member profiles, password hashes and salts when local
  password sign-in is used, invite and session token hashes, and the team identity key pair.
- `~/.codex` is owned by Codex CLI and contains its login and thread data. OpenBot does not copy or
  manage Codex credentials.
- `~/.claude` is owned by Claude CLI and contains its login and session data. OpenBot does not copy
  or manage Claude credentials.
- The MCP sign-ins are kept in `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot`, encrypted by the operating
  system's secret storage in the same way as provider API keys. One record per server address holds
  the client registration and the access and refresh tokens. Removing the server in settings, or
  choosing Sign out on it, deletes its record. These values are redacted from logs, exports and diagnostics.
- The GitHub connection (Server settings > Connectors) is kept in
  `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot/openbot-github-connector-v1.json`, encrypted by the operating
  system's secret storage. It holds the GitHub access and refresh tokens, the account name, ID and
  avatar address, and the port and secret of the local GitHub MCP server.
  While the connection is on, `provider-state/github` in the same folder holds the access token and
  the OpenBot GitHub App's installation tokens in plain text, with mode 0600, for `gh` and `git` in
  agent tools. OpenBot deletes that folder when you disconnect and when the app closes; after a crash
  it stays until the next start. The tokens are redacted from logs, exports and diagnostics.
- The Bitwarden connection keeps a CLI session key in process memory only. OpenBot does not
  save it to a file. Disconnect, eight hours without vault use, and app exit stop this connection.
  The log redactor can retain values in memory until exit to mask later messages.
  The Bitwarden CLI keeps its own encrypted vault cache. OpenBot reads login items in the folder
  `Shared with OpenBot`. Agents receive item ids, titles, and usernames; passwords and authenticator
  codes go through the main process to the browser page. This folder is an OpenBot access rule;
  the CLI session key can decrypt the wider vault. Use a separate Bitwarden account if you need
  the password manager itself to enforce that separation.
- The 1Password connection (Marketplace > 1Password) is kept in
  `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot/openbot-onepassword-connector-v1.json`, encrypted by the
  operating system's secret storage. It holds the service account token and the account ID only.
  OpenBot keeps the list of logins (titles and web addresses) in memory, never on disk. A password
  or a one-time code is read from 1Password when the browser fills it, goes only to that page, and
  is never sent to an agent, a provider, a log or a team member. The token and each filled value
  are redacted from logs, exports and diagnostics.
- `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot/logs/trace.ndjson` is a local trace of IPC calls,
  provider turns, main-process failures, and the steps of each connection to a joined server. Each
  line holds a time, the IPC channel name, the turn origin, the failure origin (`uncaughtException`
  or `unhandledRejection`) or the connection step (such as `remote-connect:ticket`), the duration,
  and the outcome word. A connection step does not name the server. The failure's error text goes only to the redacted log. The trace holds no payloads,
  messages, URLs, paths, or identifiers, and it goes through log redaction before it is written. It
  is kept to two files of 2 MB each and is never sent.

Attachments copied into OpenBot remain in managed storage after their original file is moved or
deleted. All agents share the embedded browser profile, including cookies and website sessions.
Websites receive the browser's Chromium user agent. HTTPS sites and local loopback HTTP sites also
receive basic client hints with the Chromium major version, operating-system name, and desktop flag.
Google account requests retain the Electron version token for sign-in compatibility.

## Remote Team API

When the owner publishes OpenBot, the app starts an authenticated Team API on a localhost port. The
client and host use a separate OpenBot Signal service to establish WebRTC. Signal carries only
short-lived authentication, SDP, and ICE messages. Team API data uses WebRTC DataChannels. Remote
Desktop media and input use a separate WebRTC connection. A paste in the Remote Desktop viewer
sends the member's clipboard text to the host, which puts it on the host's clipboard. The live browser view sends compressed
images of the host's browser tab, and the watching member's pointer and key input, over that same
media connection. ICE uses a direct peer-to-peer path when possible. If a direct path is not possible, encrypted WebRTC traffic uses an OpenBot coturn relay.

Agents, conversations, queues, direct messages, attachments, browser data, prompts, approvals, and
Remote Desktop data remain on the host. The central account service does not copy them into D1 or
R2. The Signal service does not proxy them or write them to logs. The host does not need a public
inbound port. The things Signal passes to a host are the Slack events of an agent's Slack app, the
Discord mentions of the Discord app, the updates of the OpenBot Telegram bot, and the requests to
webhook routines, in transit; see [Slack connections](#slack-connections),
[Discord connections](#discord-connections), [Telegram connections](#telegram-connections), and
[Webhook routines](#webhook-routines). For Discord and Telegram, Signal also carries the host's
answers to the platform.

An owner or admin of a joined server can manage its host from their own computer, or from the
browser client at `/app`. A provider API key, a custom endpoint key or header, the code that a
provider sign-in page shows, and a new server logo then travel from that computer or browser to the host over the same encrypted team connection. The
browser does not store a key. The host stores them as it stores a change made on the host.
No response returns a key, and neither computer writes request bodies to its logs. For a sign-in on
another device, the host sends the provider's sign-in link, and for Codex, Grok and Cline its
one-time code, to that computer or browser, which shows them and opens the link only when the admin
asks. The provider's CLI on the host receives the login; no token travels to the admin.

## Other network connections

Network traffic can also occur when:

- the local Codex App Server connects to OpenAI;
- the local Claude Agent SDK connects to Anthropic through Claude CLI;
- a user or an agent visits a page in the embedded browser;
- a user submits text that is not a web address in the browser address bar, which sends the query to Google Search;
- a locally installed Codex plugin connects to its service;
- an MCP server the user enabled is reached at its own address, and, when that server asks for a
  sign-in, OpenBot connects to the server's authorization service to register itself, to exchange
  the grant the browser returns, and to renew the token. Nothing about the user's agents,
  conversations or files is sent in those requests;
- the user presses Install on the 1Password page. OpenBot downloads the 1Password CLI release that it
  pins from `cache.agilebits.com`, checks its SHA-256, and keeps it in
  `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot/provider-state/1password-cli`. The request carries no user
  data;
- the user connects Bitwarden. OpenBot runs the installed `bw` CLI to sync with the server already
  configured in that CLI, including a self-hosted server. It syncs before listing or filling logins.
  These calls send no OpenBot conversations, files, or agent instructions to Bitwarden;
- the user connects 1Password. Connect runs the user's own 1Password CLI (`op`) on this computer to
  create the vault "Shared with OpenBot" and a service account that can read only it. OpenBot then
  reads that vault from 1Password's servers with the token: the vault names, the login titles and
  web addresses, and, when an agent signs in to a site, that login's username and password or code.
  Nothing about the user's agents, conversations or files is sent to 1Password;
- the user connects GitHub in Server settings. OpenBot asks `github.com` for a sign-in code and a
  token, renews the token, and reads the account name and the repositories of the OpenBot GitHub App
  from `api.github.com`. The GitHub page in Server settings loads the account picture from the
  address that GitHub gives, on GitHub's image host. Agents then reach the
  GitHub MCP server at `api.githubcopilot.com` and GitHub itself through `gh` and `git`, with that
  token. So that GitHub shows the OpenBot app as the author of an agent's work, OpenBot sends that
  token to the central account service (`api.openbot.run`) about once an hour, and when you open the
  repository list. The service uses it
  only to ask GitHub which repositories you can push to, and gets back short-lived installation
  tokens for those repositories. It does not store or log either token, and it gets no chats, files
  or commands. Agents reach the GitHub MCP server through a local server on `127.0.0.1`, which adds
  the right token to each call;
- an installed build checks GitHub Releases for updates;
- OpenBot checks for new provider CLI releases when it starts, once an hour, and when you select
  `Check for updates`. It asks `api.github.com` for Codex, `registry.npmjs.org` for Claude,
  OpenCode and Cline, `x.ai/cli` for Grok, and `raw.githubusercontent.com/agentclientprotocol/registry` and
  `dl.google.com` (for the download size) for Gemini, and the same registry and
  `downloads.cursor.com` (for the download size) for Cursor, and it reads a list of blocked
  versions from `raw.githubusercontent.com/nightly-labs/openbot`. These requests contain no account, agent,
  conversation or file data;
- an agent shows a visual reply, an agent checks its page with `html_preview`, or a user opens an
  HTML file in the file preview. The page is HTML that the agent or the file wrote. It runs its
  scripts in a sandbox and can load scripts, styles, fonts and images from any address, such as a
  CDN. The server that holds those files gets the request and the network address of the computer,
  but no OpenBot cookies. The page cannot read the app, the conversation or other
  files. `html_preview` draws the page in a hidden window that has its own
  session in memory. The mobile app does not run the page: it shows the page as its file;
- a user opens an explicitly labeled external support or setup link;
- a Slack workspace is connected. See [Slack connections](#slack-connections);
- a Discord server is connected. See [Discord connections](#discord-connections);
- a Telegram chat is connected. See [Telegram connections](#telegram-connections).

## Webhook routines

An administrator can give a routine a webhook trigger. The routine then gets a public URL and a
signing secret. The host stores the trigger and the encrypted secret in its local SQLite database.
The signing secret is encrypted with the operating system's secret storage. It is shown one time.
Management screens do not return saved secrets.

Requests to a webhook routine pass through OpenBot's Signal service to the connected host. Signal
uses the sender's IP address in memory for rate limits. The account service keeps only the route
metadata above. Neither cloud service stores or logs request bodies. The host verifies the request
signature before it accepts the event. If the host is offline, the sender receives an error and
must retry. There is no cloud event queue.

The host keeps a receipt of each request for 7 days, to ignore a repeated delivery. A receipt has
the delivery ID, the event type, the result, and the run ID, but not the request body. The event is
added to the run instruction, which the host stores with the run. Event data can reach the
routine's model provider, as other routine input does.

Change a routine to a schedule, or delete it, to stop its URL. Deleting a routine deletes its
receipts.

## Slack connections

A workspace member installs the OpenBot Slack app in their workspace from OpenBot on their computer.
The account service exchanges that install with Slack, because the app's secret lives there. It
records which OpenBot computer answers the workspace: the Slack workspace ID, the computer, the
OpenBot account that connected it, and the Slack app and bot user IDs. It keeps no Slack token and no
message. It gives the bot token to the computer encrypted to a key that only that computer has.

Slack sends the workspace's events, which contain the Slack messages in the channels OpenBot is in
and its direct messages, to OpenBot's Signal service (`signal.openbot.run`). Signal checks Slack's
signature and reads only the app ID and the workspace ID, to find the computer. It passes each request to that
computer over its Signal connection, in transit only: it does not store or log the message. The
answers go from the computer to the Slack Web API directly.

- **Stored on the host.** The bot token is encrypted by the operating system's secret storage, like
  provider API keys, and redacted from logs, exports and diagnostics. The database holds the
  workspace name and IDs, which agent is its Slack Orchestrator, and one row per Slack
  thread that an agent answers. The messages of that thread are kept as a conversation of that
  agent, with the Slack display name of each author, and files people send are kept with the agent's
  attachments. Disconnect revokes and removes the token and keeps the conversations; deleting an
  agent removes its conversations.
- **Read from Slack.** The messages that mention OpenBot, the replies in a thread an agent answers,
  its direct messages, the files in them, the display names of their authors, the names of the
  channels, and earlier messages of a thread as context. OpenBot joins every public channel of the
  workspace, and Slack sends every message of each channel that OpenBot is in; the computer keeps
  only the messages that address OpenBot or continue a conversation.
- **Given to the Slack Orchestrator.** Every new Slack request goes first to the orchestrator agent,
  which runs on its provider like any other agent and passes the work to a teammate with the facts
  it needs.
- **Sent to Slack.** The agents' answers and the files they attach, short status posts ("Working on
  it…"), reactions, and approval requests with the command, folder and
  reason the provider gave, redacted. A failed request posts a fixed sentence, never the provider's
  error.

Anyone who can post in the Slack workspace, guests and Slack Connect members included, can give the
agents work. The agents run on the host with the access the user gave them. A hosted server stays awake
while a Slack connection is live.

## Discord connections

A member of a Discord server with the **Manage Server** permission installs the OpenBot Discord app in
that server from OpenBot on their computer. The account service exchanges that install with Discord,
because the app's secret lives there, and revokes the Discord sign-in token that it gets at once. It
records which OpenBot computer answers the Discord server: the Discord server ID, the computer and the
OpenBot account that connected it. It keeps no Discord token and no message.

Discord has one bot token for every server, so only OpenBot's Signal service (`signal.openbot.run`)
holds it. Unlike Slack, both directions go through Signal:

- **To the computer.** Signal keeps the bot's connection to Discord. Discord sends it the messages of
  the channels OpenBot can view, with text only for the messages that mention OpenBot. Signal passes
  on only those messages and the presses of OpenBot's buttons: the message text, the author's ID and
  name, the channel, the message it replies to, and the addresses of its files. The computer
  downloads the files from Discord directly.
- **From the computer.** The computer sends its posts, edits, reactions, files and name lookups to
  Signal, which makes each call to Discord for it, only in the Discord servers linked to that
  computer. To give context, the computer asks Signal for the earlier messages of a channel after the
  first message of a conversation.

Signal does not store or log a message, a file or a token; it keeps the server and channel names and
IDs in memory to check each call. It answers a direct message to OpenBot with one fixed sentence and
passes nothing on.

- **Stored on the host.** The Discord server's name and ID, which agent is its Discord Orchestrator,
  and one row per conversation that an agent answers, kept as a conversation of that agent with the
  Discord display name of each author. Files people send are kept with the agent's attachments.
  Disconnect removes the link and keeps the conversations; deleting an agent removes its
  conversations.
- **Given to the Discord Orchestrator.** As for Slack.
- **Sent to Discord.** As for Slack: the answers, attached files of at most 10 MB, status posts,
  reactions, and redacted approval requests. A post never pings anyone.

Anyone who can post in a channel that OpenBot can view can give the agents work. The agents run on the
host with the access the user gave them. A hosted server stays awake while a Discord connection is
live.

## Telegram connections

One OpenBot Telegram bot serves every user. Its token is only in OpenBot's Signal service
(`signal.openbot.run`); no computer has it. The user connects a chat from OpenBot on their computer:
the account service gives a one-use code, and the browser opens a `t.me` link with it. When the user
adds the bot to a group, or starts a direct chat with it, Telegram sends the code in that chat.
Signal then asks the account service to link the chat to the computer. The account service records
the Telegram chat ID, the bot ID, the computer, the OpenBot account and the time of the link, and a
hash of each code until it is used or expires. It keeps no chat name and no message.

Telegram sends each update of a linked chat, which contains the messages that mention the bot or reply
to it, the messages of a direct chat, and button presses, to Signal. Signal checks Telegram's secret
header and reads only the chat ID, a link code and the ID of a button press, to find the computer. It
passes each update to that computer over its Signal connection, in transit only: it does not store or
log it. The computer's answers, status posts, reactions and files go to Telegram through Signal,
because only Signal has the token. Signal accepts only a fixed list of Bot API calls, only for the
chats linked to that computer, and returns only message IDs to it. Files go through Signal with
short-lived signed addresses, in transit only.

- **Stored on the host.** The bot ID, the bot username, the chat ID and the chat name are encrypted
  by the operating system's secret storage and redacted from logs, exports and diagnostics. The
  database holds the chat name and IDs, which agent is the Telegram Orchestrator, and one row per
  conversation that an agent answers. The messages of that conversation are kept as a conversation
  of that agent, with the Telegram name of each author, and files people send are kept with the
  agent's attachments. The names of authors and the last messages of a chat are also kept in memory
  for context, until OpenBot quits. Disconnect makes the bot leave the chat, unlinks it and keeps
  the conversations; deleting an agent removes its conversations.
- **Read from Telegram.** The messages that mention the bot, replies to it and the other messages of a
  reply chain that Telegram sends, the messages of a direct chat, the message that a request
  answers, the files in them, the names of their authors and the name of the chat. With privacy
  mode on, which is Telegram's default for a bot, Telegram sends a bot only messages that mention it,
  replies to it and commands.
- **Given to the Telegram Orchestrator.** Every new Telegram request goes first to the orchestrator
  agent, which runs on its provider like any other agent and passes the work to a teammate with the
  facts it needs.
- **Sent to Telegram.** The agents' answers and the files they attach, short status posts ("Working on
  it…"), reactions, and approval requests with the command, folder and reason the provider gave,
  redacted. A failed request posts a fixed sentence, never the provider's error.

Anyone who can post in a linked chat can give the agents work. The agents run on the host with the
access the user gave them. A hosted server stays awake while a Telegram connection is live.

Plugin pages on openbot.run show each listing's own icon. The page asks `openbot.run` for that
picture, and the website fetches it there from the address the plugin catalog holds, so reading a
plugin page does not connect your browser to the plugin developer's servers.

Account usage shown in OpenBot is requested through the local Codex App Server. OpenBot does not send
that usage to its maintainer.

## Agent access

Agents currently use `danger-full-access` with `approvalPolicy: never`. They can read and modify local
files, run programs, use the network, and control the embedded browser without an OpenBot confirmation
dialog. This is an explicit product behavior, not a host security boundary. Keep backups and do not
give an agent a task you would not allow a local command-line tool to perform.

On first launch, OpenBot explains this access and does not start the agent services until you
explicitly accept it. The acceptance record stays in OpenBot's local application-support directory.

Computer Use is provided by `cua-driver`, a local binary that OpenBot ships and starts as its own
child process. It starts only when you open the Computer Use panel or an agent uses the function, and
it stops when OpenBot stops. Because OpenBot starts it directly, macOS attributes the Screen Recording
and Accessibility grants to OpenBot, and macOS keeps control of the prompts. Windows and Linux ask for
no such grant. Screen contents and accessibility trees that an agent reads through the driver go to
that agent's provider, the same as any other message content.

The driver is third-party software with its own product analytics, which its vendor turns on by
default and which are not OpenBot's. They would send the driver version, the operating system, a
random installation identifier, and a bucketed record of each tool call to that vendor. They never
send screen contents, window or application names, typed text, or the content of a tool result.

On its own the driver also asks GitHub for a newer release each time it starts.

**OpenBot stops both calls, always.** Every copy of the driver OpenBot starts gets
`CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` and `CUA_DRIVER_RS_UPDATE_CHECK=0`, so it sends the vendor
nothing and asks GitHub nothing. OpenBot pins the driver version it packages, so a release check
could only offer you an update OpenBot would refuse. The driver reads the environment before its own
configuration, and OpenBot sets both variables last, so nothing can turn them back on for a driver
OpenBot started. OpenBot writes no file, so a driver you run yourself keeps the settings you gave
it.

Auto approve also permits that agent to publish, update and delete public hosted sites without
another confirmation. Turbo mode extends this permission to every agent on that host. Publishing
makes the selected site content publicly accessible. Without either grant, hosted-site changes
require confirmation. Site ownership and source validation still apply.

## Exports

The account menu can export a local ZIP containing agent profiles, conversation snapshots, queues,
and managed message attachments. It intentionally excludes CLI credentials, browser cookies, and
agent workspace files.

The diagnostics export contains application and CLI versions, capability states, aggregate queue
counts, and a summary of the local trace: counts, outcomes, and durations for each IPC channel,
turn origin, and failure origin. It contains no conversations, visited URLs, account email, file
contents, or local file paths.

## Delete local data

Quit OpenBot, then remove the OpenBot folders listed above. Removing
`~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot` also removes the embedded browser's cookies and logins.
Removing `~/OpenBot` removes agent workspaces, transfers, downloads, and the records the agents kept. OpenBot does not delete
`~/.codex` or `~/.claude`; use each CLI's own controls if you also want to remove its local data.

Review folders before deleting them and keep a backup of anything you need.

## Questions

Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nightly-labs/openbot/discussions) for privacy questions.
Report vulnerabilities privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), without attaching
credentials, conversations, or unrelated private files.

When you ask OpenBot to generate or revise an agent profile, it sends your setup
prompt, the current profile draft (when present), and available sidebar section
names and identifiers to the selected AI provider through its local CLI. This
request does not include conversation history, saved memories, or workspace files.
The draft is reviewed before OpenBot saves it; generating a draft does not create
an OpenBot conversation or change an existing agent. The provider's own data and
CLI retention policies still apply.

When you change an agent's provider, the new provider receives the chat history with its first
message. That history includes the work steps that the previous provider recorded: commands, the end
of their output, changed file paths, tool names, searches and progress notes. OpenBot removes known
secrets from these steps first. Command output can contain file contents. Reasoning, diffs and
attachment contents are not sent.

Publishing an agent template from the chat makes its instructions, skills, and routines public to
anyone with the link at `openbot.run/agents/<id>`, with your account name as the creator. OpenBot
stops the publish when a text field looks like a secret. Workspace files and memories are not sent.
An owner or admin of a server can also publish, update or unpublish an agent of that server from the
browser client. The host sends the template content and the agent's avatar to that browser for the
preview, and publishes with the account signed in on the host, so that account is the creator.

Marketplace submissions from the desktop app show the publisher’s current account photo publicly on the listing. Account photo updates appear on the listing; removing the account photo removes it from the listing. Private memories and integration credentials are not included.

### OpenCode

OpenBot downloads the OpenCode CLI and its license (from the `opencode-ai` package) from
`registry.npmjs.org`, then starts it with `opencode acp`. Prompts, attachments, and tool
results go to that local process. OpenCode can send them to the model provider selected in its
configuration. OpenCode's free models are the default, and they reach OpenCode Go with no account,
so a first OpenCode turn leaves this computer without a sign-in.

An OpenCode Go key is optional and unlocks the paid catalog. OpenBot encrypts it with the operating
system's secret storage, writes it to a file that only your user account can read, and passes it
to the local OpenCode process. To show the remaining Go quota in Usage, OpenBot also sends the key
to `opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage`; that request contains no conversation, file, or model data, and
the response contains only the used percentage and reset time of each Go limit. OpenBot does not
send that usage to its maintainer. No screen, log, data export, or diagnostics report contains the
key; the data export lists it under `scope.excludes`. OpenBot does not copy OpenCode credentials or
upload its session files. OpenCode manages its own login and resume state.

### Gemini

OpenBot downloads Google's Antigravity ACP server from `dl.google.com` when you select Download on
the Gemini row. Each provider update check also asks `dl.google.com` for the size of the newest
download, also when you do not use Gemini. Google's license does not let OpenBot include it in the application. OpenBot
starts the server as a local process. Prompts, attachments, and tool results go to that process,
and the server sends them to Google. Sign in opens Google's sign-in page in your browser. The
server keeps its login and session files in `~/.gemini`, or in `$GEMINI_HOME`. OpenBot does not
read, copy, or upload these files. Google's terms apply: <https://antigravity.google/terms>.
Gemini agents stay on this computer: OpenBot does not show them to team members.

### Cursor

OpenBot downloads the Cursor CLI from `downloads.cursor.com` when you select Download on the Cursor
row. Each provider update check also asks `downloads.cursor.com` for the size of the newest
download, also when you do not use Cursor. OpenBot starts the CLI as a local process. Prompts,
attachments, and tool results go to that process, and the CLI sends them to Cursor. Sign in opens
Cursor's sign-in page in your browser, or the CLI uses `CURSOR_API_KEY` from the environment that
started OpenBot. OpenBot gives that key only to the local CLI, in its environment, and does
not store it. The CLI keeps its login and session files
in `~/.cursor` (on Linux, the login is in `~/.config/cursor`). OpenBot does not read, copy, or
upload these files. Cursor's terms apply: <https://cursor.com/terms-of-service>. Team members see
the host's Cursor agents, as for the other providers, when their app supports Cursor.

### Cline

OpenBot downloads the Cline CLI from `registry.npmjs.org`, and its license file from `github.com`,
when you select Download on the Cline row. OpenBot starts the CLI as a local process. Prompts,
attachments, and tool results go to that process, and the CLI sends them to Cline and to the model
provider you select in Cline. The provider of a free model can use your prompts to train models.
Sign in opens Cline's sign-in page in your browser, or the CLI uses `CLINE_API_KEY` from the
environment that started OpenBot. OpenBot gives that key only to the local CLI, in its environment,
and does not store it. The CLI keeps its login and session files in `~/.cline`, or in `$CLINE_DIR`.
OpenBot does not read, copy, or upload these files. Cline's terms apply:
<https://cline.bot/tos>. Team members see the host's Cline agents, as
for the other providers, when their app supports Cline.

### Local model servers

When Server settings shows the Providers section of this computer, and once on the onboarding
provider step, OpenBot looks
for model servers on this computer. It sends `GET <address>/models` to
`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` (Ollama), `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` (LM Studio), and each address you
add under Local detection. These requests
contain no key, header, conversation or file data, and OpenBot does not follow a redirect. A found
server is only listed; OpenBot saves nothing until you select Add.

When you add or edit an endpoint, Load models sends the key and headers you typed to that address.
For a saved endpoint, OpenBot sends the stored key and headers only to the same origin as the saved
address. Local detection can be turned off in Settings. Its switch, addresses, folders and hidden
rows are in `openbot-provider-detection-v1.json` in the app profile.

### Custom agents

A custom agent is an ACP program that you name. OpenBot starts it as a local process, and prompts, attachments, and tool results go to that process. What the program sends
to the network is its own choice. Check agent starts it once, sends only `initialize`, and stops it.
To find agents, OpenBot looks up the names of known agents on your `PATH` and in the folders you
add under Local detection. It does not start a file that it finds.

The command, arguments, and environment names are in `custom-agents.json` in the app profile. The
environment values are encrypted with the operating system's secret storage, go only to that
process, and are not in a screen, log, data export, or diagnostics report; the data export lists
them under `scope.excludes`. Custom agents stay on this computer: OpenBot does not show them to
team members.

## Shared desktop channels

Channel names, purposes, participating agents, linked conversation references, messages, tasks,
assignment records, history summaries, and human read positions are stored in the host's SQLite
database. All authenticated members of that server can read and use its channels. Agent membership
selects participating agents; it is not a separate human access boundary.

The selected lead's provider receives relevant channel content for routing and history summaries in
separate sessions without work tools. Assigned agents receive the channel purpose, responsibilities,
request, relevant source messages, shared history summary, recent messages, and attachment references.
Agents can retrieve earlier channel messages and other conversations on that server when needed.
Unrelated conversations are not sent automatically. Provider session internals remain internal.
The provider's own data policies apply to content it receives.

Archiving a channel stops its work and retains its transcript. Restore makes the channel available again.
These actions do not remove agents, their memories, or linked conversations. Channel traffic between
desktop clients and a host uses the existing host transport. The account API and Signal service do
not store channel chats or make routing decisions. This feature adds no mobile chat interface.

## Mobile queue drafts

A phone stores the text and attachment references of an active queue edit in its secure local
storage, and keeps a copy of each file the edit adds in its own application storage, so it can
recover the edit after navigation or restart. These copies stay on the phone and are removed when
the edit is saved or cancelled. The host keeps the original message and a persistent edit hold
until the edit is saved, cancelled, or the message is deleted.

The desktop editor also keeps its active queue edit, attachment references, and edit identity in
local application storage. This lets it recover the held draft after restart. Neither client
releases the host hold merely because the editor closes or disconnects. The host also preserves
attachment drafts released by edit cancellation or message deletion until they are sent or
discarded. This lets a disconnected desktop recover its saved composer backup after host restart.

## iPhone Live Activity

The iPhone app can show the state of the agents on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island. While
the app runs, the phone makes this view itself from the data that it receives over the encrypted
host connection.

When iOS stops the app in the background, the active host updates the view through Apple Push
Notification service (APNs). For this, the phone gives that host, over the encrypted host
connection, the push token of the Live Activity, a 32-byte secret for that host, its interface
language, and the file names of the agent pictures that it saved on the phone. The phone makes each
host secret from one random phone secret, so one host cannot seal an update or sign a button for
another host. The phone keeps its secret in its secure storage and makes a new one when the user
signs out. The host keeps these values in
memory only, for the session that gave them. It forgets them when the phone removes them, when the
session ends, when the member is removed or disabled, when Apple refuses the token, after 12 hours,
and when the host stops.

Each update contains the text that the view shows: agent names, the current task, the last reply,
a question and its options, or a command that waits for approval. The host seals the update with
keys made from the secret (an HMAC-SHA256 keystream and an HMAC-SHA256 tag) and sends it to the
OpenBot account service, which sends it to Apple. The account service and Apple receive only the
push token, the sealed bytes, the time, the priority, and the time when the content becomes out of
date. They cannot read the content. The widget on the phone opens it and shows nothing with a
wrong tag. The account service stores nothing from these requests and does not log them. It makes
the Apple request itself and adds no text, so a host cannot use it to send an ordinary
notification. Apple can keep its own delivery logs under its own policy.

The buttons in the view open the app. A button that changes host state, such as Approve or an
answer, has a signature made with a key that only the phone and the host have, so another app
cannot start the action with an `openbot://` link. The app shows the command again before it
approves it.

Settings > Live Activities turns this off. The phone then removes its token from the
host.

## Optional macOS Host Manager

An administrator can install a local Host Manager for several native macOS users. It reads only
registered UIDs, process IDs, application versions, restart readiness, timestamps, and health
booleans through separate local status directories. It does not read or back up tenant homes,
workspaces, databases, provider directories, browser data, or conversations. It requests release
metadata and application downloads from the fixed OpenBot GitHub repository; those requests
expose the host's network address to GitHub. It sends no tenant status or tenant content to GitHub.

The separate, optional administrator account-setup command creates new local Standard users and
empty private homes. It saves generated login passwords in a root-only file under
`/private/var/root` for the administrator to retrieve. It does not transmit those credentials or
include them in logs. The installed administrator CLI shows each password once on the controlling terminal after setup,
then removes the recovery file. A failed setup retains that root-only file for administrator recovery.
The administrator controls secure password delivery. Host verification reads home metadata only
and tests cross-user access using harmless temporary files outside tenant homes.

### Remote desktop setup diagnostics

When an authenticated server member checks remote desktop setup, the host sends its computer name,
macOS account name, permission and service results, active session count, and check time to that member.
A live test also sends a temporary four-digit code and mouse and keyboard test results. These results
stay in memory and are not sent to analytics. Screen video uses the existing remote desktop connection.
Permission approval remains in macOS System Settings on the host.

## Secure browser authentication

Passwords, email/SMS codes, and authenticator codes entered in a secure chat card are sent to the
shown HTTPS site for one submission. Connected desktop and mobile clients send the value through
the authenticated Team API to the computer running the browser. The handoff does not add the value
to chat, provider tool arguments, diagnostics, analytics, or a credential store. Input and submission
values are held in memory for the operation; cancellation and submission clear the input.

OpenBot blocks agent browser access while consent is pending. Before entering a submitted value, it
blocks image capture and live browser streams, and stops
and discards the active browser recording before entry. After entry, protection stays until the
browser replaces the document. After a same-page submission, OpenBot clears the filled fields and,
when the value no longer appears in the page title, address, text, field values, or attributes, keeps
the page, so a later login step on the same page stays available. Page code can still hold the
value, so page evaluation and recording stay blocked in that tab and its connected popup or opener
tabs until the page navigates. Otherwise OpenBot loads the current URL as a new
document with a GET request instead. Failed submission or reload requires manual takeover. Recording does not restart
automatically, and the tab's back/forward history is cleared after replacement to prevent restoring
the sensitive document. The destination site receives the value and controls its own processing.
This protection does not isolate credentials from the operating system or agents with unrestricted
machine access. Values pasted into ordinary chat are not covered by secure handoff.

## Error and warning reports

Production desktop, browser app, and mobile clients report safe failure categories to the same
self-hosted OpenPanel service. Reports can include the app version, platform, provider, model,
operation, severity, and a fixed cause code. They also record whether a problem appeared as a
toast, shared alert or chat banner, or native error/warning alert. These reports do not include displayed text,
raw exceptions, stack traces, prompts, messages, file names, paths, commands, or credentials.
A random report ID helps identify repeated delivery attempts; it is not a conversation or file ID.
A reported cause describes the error observed by OpenBot and might not explain its root cause.

Validated reports wait in local files on the host and mobile, or IndexedDB in desktop and browser
clients. Each queue is limited to 1,000 reports, 1 MiB, and seven days. Reports are removed after
OpenPanel accepts them, when they expire, or when the queue reaches its limits. Network failures
can cause retries and duplicate delivery. Queue failures do not block the application.

Turning off analytics or changing accounts clears pending reports and cancels active sends.
Requests already received by OpenPanel cannot be recalled. Anonymous error reports remain
anonymous. The browser app has its own local analytics setting in account settings, separate
from desktop and mobile. Collection is enabled by default; a malformed or unreadable setting
keeps it disabled. Existing OpenPanel retention rules apply after delivery.

### Remote host release checks

When a server administrator checks an OpenBot release, the host requests the public stable
release manifest from GitHub for its operating system and architecture. The request includes no
account data, chats, files, commands, or credentials. GitHub receives the host IP address as part
of the connection. Connected administrators receive the installed version, release version,
check status, and installation method.
## API event checks

A check can run an agent-authored API program from the host's shared Watchers folder. Programs can
be reused by separate check instances. Each instance keeps its own ordinary configuration,
private variables, baseline, and ten execution logs on the host. Settings send private values to
the authenticated host connection. They are encrypted in a private per-instance environment file;
settings and agent tools return names and configured flags, never saved values. The account Worker
does not store these variables. The host passes only declared values to the program's environment,
not inherited provider credentials. Program output is bounded and secret-redacted before event delivery.

The scheduler makes no model request for a check or test. A matching event can start the agent and
send its selected app data to the configured AI provider. Programs use the agents' existing full
computer access. File permissions and encryption do not isolate them from other files under the
same OS account, and arbitrary authored code is not an enforced read-only network sandbox. The
creation skill requires direct API reads, read-only tokens where available, and no MCP or model calls.
