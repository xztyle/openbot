# Releasing OpenBot

For iOS builds uploaded to TestFlight through GitHub Actions, see
[the mobile release guide](../apps/mobile/README.md#github-actions-testflight-release). For Android
builds uploaded to Google Play, see
[the Google Play release guide](../apps/mobile/README.md#github-actions-google-play-release).
The mobile workflows are separate from the desktop tag release described below.

OpenBot updates are published through GitHub Releases and installed with `electron-updater`.
macOS requires every auto-updatable build to be signed with a Developer ID Application certificate.
The release workflow also notarizes and staples the macOS application before publishing it. A Windows
x64 tag release is signed with Azure Artifact Signing (see [Windows signing](#windows-signing)). Linux
releases are unsigned, and the Linux AppImage carries no signature.
All three platforms must pass before one release is published. A release also requires the pinned
Sunshine and Moonlight Web runtime artifacts. GitHub Actions downloads those artifacts, checks SHA-256, and
verifies their native executables as part of the final OpenBot package. Release packages are not built
on a developer machine.

Codex, Claude, and Grok runtimes are optional downloads. They are not part of the application package.
Release CI downloads the pinned macOS, Windows, and Linux provider artifacts as control artifacts. It
checks their SHA-256 values, versions, licenses, and vendor signatures without copying them into
OpenBot. Linux has no code-signature contract to check, so its provider artifacts are verified by
SHA-256 and version only.

Installed apps do not wait for a release to get a new provider CLI: they offer the latest upstream
release (see [Provider CLI updates](architecture/providers.md#provider-cli-updates)). The pinned version is the
first-install fallback. To stop a broken upstream release, add its version to the provider's list in
`provider-runtime-blocklist.json` and merge it to `main`. Apps read the list at their next check. A
blocked version is no longer offered, but it stays on the computers that already installed it.

## One-time GitHub setup

Create the `release` environment in `nightly-labs/openbot`, then add these environment secrets:

- `CSC_LINK` — a base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` file.
- `MAC_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` — the base64-encoded Developer ID provisioning profile for
  `app.openbot.desktop`, with the `applinks:openbot.run` entitlement.
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` — the application `.p12` export password.
- `CSC_INSTALLER_LINK` — a base64-encoded **Developer ID Installer** `.p12` file for team `ZTRDTUL87R`.
- `CSC_INSTALLER_KEY_PASSWORD` — the installer `.p12` export password.
- `APPLE_ID` — the Apple Account used for notarization.
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` — a dedicated app-specific password for `notarytool`.
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — the Apple Developer team ID.

Do not use an Apple Development certificate. Direct distribution and native macOS updates require a
Developer ID Application certificate. Never commit signing credentials to the repository.

### Docker package access

The Docker image needs no secret: the `docker-publish` job pushes with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
[GHCR makes new packages private](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry),
even when the source repository is public. A successful push does not confirm public access.

After the first push, a package administrator must open the
[OpenBot package](https://github.com/orgs/nightly-labs/packages/container/package/openbot):

1. Open **Package settings** and set **Change visibility** to **Public**.
2. Check that the package is linked to `nightly-labs/openbot`. The Dockerfile sets the
   `org.opencontainers.image.source` label for this link.
3. Under **Manage Actions access**, check that `nightly-labs/openbot` has write access.

If **Public** is disabled by organization administrators, an organization owner must enable
**Public** under **Package creation** in the
[organization package settings](https://github.com/organizations/nightly-labs/settings/packages).
Make OpenBot public, then restore the previous organization policy. Existing public packages stay
public when this creation permission is disabled again.

If a release pushed its image but users cannot pull it, check these settings first. Changing
visibility makes the existing tags public; no rebuild is needed. Tags `0.30.0` and `0.31.0` have
no `v` prefix. Later releases also publish `v<version>` as an alias.

Check access with an empty Docker configuration, so a saved login cannot hide the fault:

```sh
anonymous_config=$(mktemp -d)
docker --config "$anonymous_config" manifest inspect ghcr.io/nightly-labs/openbot:latest
docker --config "$anonymous_config" manifest inspect ghcr.io/nightly-labs/openbot:0.30.0
rm -rf "$anonymous_config"
```

The release workflow checks anonymous access to the version, `v<version>` and `latest` tags,
including both Linux architectures. A failure leaves the GitHub Release and pushed images in
place. Correct the package settings, then run the failed job again.

## Hosted-server snapshots

After GitHub publication, `Publish boat server snapshot` builds the Linux x64 release into a boat
named snapshot (`openbot-server-production-<version>` with dots replaced by hyphens), then selects
it for new production servers. It uses the tagged hosting scripts,
the published `SHA256SUMS-linux.txt`, and `https://api.openbot.run`. The builder checks the AppImage
checksum and installed version and requires an empty host profile before saving the snapshot.
Existing servers and the test Worker do not change.

Before the first release with this job, configure the `cloudflare-production` GitHub Environment:

- Add `BOAT_TEMPLATE_API_KEY`, a separate boat key with sandbox, file, command and named snapshot
  access. Keep the limited `BOAT_API_KEY` on the Worker.
- Keep `CLOUDFLARE_PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_TOKEN` and the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` variable used by deployment.
- Permit the tag pattern `v*.*.*` in addition to the `main` branch. The release job runs on a tag.

`release:preflight` checks these settings. The hosted job and production Worker deployment share
one concurrency group. The job checks GitHub's latest stable release before building and again
before selection. It writes only the Worker's `HOSTED_SERVER_TEMPLATE` secret. Normal CI and local
production deployments preserve it; the old GitHub variable is ignored. `hosting:setup` now sets
up billing and webhooks only and no longer accepts `--template`.

A failed hosted job leaves the GitHub Release published and the previous template selected.
Run the failed job again after correcting the cause. A ready snapshot is reused; a save in progress
is polled; a failed snapshot requires operator inspection. The builder never replaces an existing
snapshot or deletes old snapshots. It stops at 10 snapshots even if boat permits paid storage above
that count. Confirm that neither Worker nor any pending create needs a snapshot before removing it.

A successful job reports the selected version in its Actions summary. Verify the first rollout by
creating a temporary production server and checking its initial installed version. Record the
result under `.openbot-build/`; remove only that temporary server after the check. This remote check
is separate from local checks and requires production access.

## Windows signing

A tag build signs the Windows release with Azure Artifact Signing. It needs no secret:

- The Artifact Signing account `synthetifyartifactsign` (East US, `https://eus.codesigning.azure.net/`)
  holds the Public Trust certificate profile `SYNTHETIFY`, issued to
  `SYNTHETIFY LABS SPÓŁKA Z OGRANICZONĄ ODPOWIEDZIALNOŚCIĄ`. Microsoft issues a new short-lived
  certificate each day with the same subject.
- The Entra app registration `openbot-release-signing` has the **Artifact Signing Certificate Profile
  Signer** role on that profile only. Its federated credential trusts the subject
  `repo:nightly-labs@100160810/openbot@1332461149:environment:release`, because this repository uses
  GitHub's immutable OIDC subject format. A dry run has no environment, so it cannot sign.
- The `windows` job logs in with `azure/login`, caches a token for the signing service, and runs
  `bun run dist:win --config electron-builder.windows-signing.yml`, then runs `az account clear`, so
  the steps after the build have no Azure session. That overlay adds
  `win.azureSignOptions` and `forceCodeSigning`. electron-builder signs `OpenBot.exe`, every `.exe` from
  `extraResources` (the remote desktop runtime and the Computer Use driver), the NSIS
  installer, and its uninstaller. It does not sign the `.node` and `.dll` files of the voice runtime,
  because the overlay sets no `win.signExts`. The provider CLIs are not packaged on Windows, so their
  vendor signatures do not change.
- `verify:package:win --require-signature` requires a valid signature with the `app-update.yml`
  publisher on each of those executables, and the next step requires the same signer on the
  installer. A dry run requires `NotSigned` instead.
- `-f mode=windows-signing` checks the login and the signing service without a release (see
  [Publish a version](#publish-a-version) for the command).

electron-builder writes `publisherName` to `app-update.yml`. An installed signed build accepts an
update only when its installer certificate has that CN. A change of the legal name or of the identity
validation therefore stops auto-updates for every signed install: ship a release that lists both names
in `publisherName` before the certificate changes. An unsigned install has no `publisherName` and
accepts the first signed update.

The signature removes the Unknown publisher warning. SmartScreen can still warn until the new
certificate builds download reputation.

## Build the remote desktop runtime

`native-runtime.lock.json` pins the upstream source for Sunshine `v2026.516.143833` and Moonlight Web
`v2.10.0` by full commit and source archive SHA-256. Each entry also records the reviewable OpenBot
patch applied to that source. Build on the target platform:

```bash
bun run build:remote-desktop-runtime
bun run verify:remote-desktop-runtime
```

The command writes binaries, the static Moonlight viewer, GPL-3.0 licenses, corresponding-source
metadata, and SHA-256 checksums under `build/remote-desktop-runtime/<platform>/<arch>`. Publish the
exact corresponding source for both GPL components with every binary release. A release must stop if
a binary, license, source manifest, checksum, platform signature, or notarization result is missing.

Use this source build only to make or reproduce a runtime version. The
`.github/workflows/remote-desktop-runtime.yml` workflow builds macOS ARM64, macOS x64 and Windows x64 when the
recipe or a pinned input changes. It publishes an immutable GitHub prerelease named
`remote-desktop-runtime-<input-digest>`. The prerelease contains the three deterministic archives, SPDX
SBOMs, build provenance, and `remote-desktop-runtime-manifest.json`. It is not an OpenBot application
update and it must never contain `latest.yml`.

PR pushes do not cancel an active runtime build. The next run reuses a successful native build
from the same PR and platform when its native inputs and build tools are unchanged. It still runs
verification and the macOS smoke test against the current checkout. A cache miss rebuilds the
runtime. Pushes to `main` and manual dispatches do not use the PR build cache.

After publication, the workflow opens a draft PR that adds the release tag and SHA-256 values to
`native-runtime.lock.json`. That job runs only from `main`, because it pins against the lock it checks
out: the input digest is derived from the recipe on disk, and a manifest built from a different recipe
is refused.

So a branch that changes the recipe pins by hand, and must, or merging it leaves `main` with an
unpinned lock -- which is not a degraded state but a broken one, because
`prepare-remote-desktop-runtime.ts` throws and takes every `package`, `dist:mac` and `dist:win` run
with it. From the branch:

```bash
gh workflow run remote-desktop-runtime.yml --ref <branch>
# once Publish and Verify published are green:
gh release download remote-desktop-runtime-<input-digest> --pattern remote-desktop-runtime-manifest.json
bun scripts/pin-remote-desktop-runtime.ts remote-desktop-runtime-manifest.json
```

To repeat verification after a download or CI setup failure, without replacing the published
artifacts, run `gh workflow run remote-desktop-runtime.yml --ref <branch> -f verify_only=true`.
This mode requires an existing release for the current input digest and runs installation, runtime
verification, the macOS smoke test, and application packaging. It does not build or publish.

Commit the rewritten `native-runtime.lock.json` to the branch and merge it with the recipe, so `main`
never sees the two apart. The pin does not change the input digest -- it covers `recipeVersion`, both
source entries and `targets`, not the artifacts -- so it cannot invalidate the release it just pinned.

Normal CI and application release jobs then use:

```bash
bun run install:remote-desktop-runtime
bun run verify:remote-desktop-runtime
```

The installer accepts only the exact prerelease and assets in the lock file. It rejects a changed
manifest, a changed archive, an unsafe archive path, and a mismatched source manifest. Do not replace
assets in an existing runtime prerelease. Increase `recipeVersion` when the build process changes.

### Sunshine security backports (runtime recipe 12)

The Sunshine upstream base remains `v2026.516.143833` to keep the tested macOS input backend.
The OpenBot patch includes these upstream security changes and regression tests:

- `1583e7c4a7e99538c7700315a1d2a2101c6d2812`: validate input packets before queueing and
  dispatch (GHSA-26q2-58j6-qmvv and GHSA-6w33-pjh7-p77c).
- `82bccdf69894ee03ac422cc787f1ac9654da359d`: reject short ENet control packets
  (GHSA-c428-87f8-rrv5).
- `ccf97e38796be6cfcbff0ef248a684d39e181eba`: bind pairing approval to an explicit,
  expiring request ID (GHSA-36ff-frg7-492f).
- `4d768847fcd88cc94ac745c4611715c67d7d67e1`: require the exact enabled client
  certificate and canonicalize stored certificate identities (GHSA-6jvv-jqr7-m6m3).

Backport adaptations retain the older platform APIs and test fixtures. Native CI builds and runs
only the relevant packet, pairing, REST authorization, and certificate regression tests. The local
Moonlight client uses a random pairing name and approves only its matching loopback request ID.
Moonlight now builds from the same upstream commit with the existing OpenBot patch and a fix
that sends the configured pairing name instead of the upstream hard-coded name.
The published runtime uses a new recipe/input digest; no existing release assets are replaced.
The Linux GUI capability advisory GHSA-fp6g-27w5-489j does not apply: the Linux runtime is built
with the tray off, and OpenBot gives Sunshine no file capabilities.

### Linux runtime (recipe 14)

The `linux-x64` target builds on Ubuntu 24.04 with GCC 14, X11 capture and software encoding only
(CUDA, DRM, KWin, VAAPI, Vulkan, Wayland, portal and tray are off). The OpenBot patch adds an XTest
input backend, because Xvfb does not read uinput devices. It also links libcap when DRM is off and
adds a `vaMapBuffer2` shim, because the prebuilt FFmpeg needs libva 2.21 and Ubuntu 24.04 has 2.20.
The runtime uses the system libraries of Ubuntu 24.04; the hosted server template installs them.
Linux arm64 builds only for local development and has no release artifact.

## Pin the Gemini server

`native-runtime.lock.json` pins Google's Antigravity ACP server for the Gemini provider by hand:
the version from the ACP registry entry `antigravity-acp`, and for each target the zip name, its
SHA-256 and size, and the SHA-256 of `agy_acp_server` and `localharness_external` in it. Download
each zip from the registry `archive` URL, hash the zip and the two files, and set `installedBytes`
above the extracted size. Do not commit the zip: Google's license does not allow redistribution.

## Pin the Cursor CLI

`native-runtime.lock.json` pins the Cursor CLI by hand. Read the ACP registry entry `cursor`: its
`version` is the date, and each `archive` URL has the build, a date and a commit such as
`2026.09.28-64d2043`. Set `version` to the build. For each target, download
`downloads.cursor.com/lab/<build>/<os>/<arch>/agent-cli-package.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows), and
set the archive SHA-256 and size, `installedBytes` above the extracted size, and the SHA-256 of
each file in `files`. The paths in `files` are relative to `dist-package/`. Do not commit the
archives: Cursor's terms do not allow redistribution.

## Pin the Cline CLI

`native-runtime.lock.json` pins the Cline CLI by hand. Read the npm `latest` version of
`@cline/cli-darwin-arm64` and set `version`. For each target, download the platform package
`@cline/cli-<os>-<arch>` (`windows-x64` for Windows) from `registry.npmjs.org`, and set the tarball
SHA-256 and size, the SHA-256 of `bin/cline` (`bin/cline.exe` on Windows) and of
`extensions/plugin-sandbox-bootstrap.js`, and `installedBytes` above the extracted size. The npm
packages have no license file, so set `licenseSha256` to the SHA-256 of `LICENSE` at the
`cli-v<version>` tag of `github.com/cline/cline`.

## Pin the OpenCode CLI

`native-runtime.lock.json` also pins the OpenCode CLI that OpenBot downloads for the OpenCode
provider before its first update check answers, by npm platform package, asset SHA-256, extracted binary SHA-256, byte counts, and the
MIT license file it takes from the `opencode-ai` npm package. Codex, Claude, and Grok are pinned
in the same file by hand; OpenCode has a script, because the version, both platform packages, and
the license have to agree:

```bash
bun run pin:opencode-runtime          # the newest published release
bun run pin:opencode-runtime 1.18.30  # one exact version
```

The script downloads both platform tarballs, checks that `package/package.json` names the package
and version the lock claims, hashes the extracted binary and the license, and on macOS runs the
extracted binary with `--version` and refuses a value that is not the pinned one. That last check is
what protects `verifyInstalledRuntime`, which compares the installed version for exact equality. The
script prints the block for review instead of rewriting the lock, so paste it over the `opencode`
entry and re-run it with that exact version: the command reports `already pins OpenCode <version>`
when the committed block matches byte for byte.

Run it on a version bump only. A bump also needs the Windows checks in
[the OpenCode notes](architecture/providers.md#opencode-and-acp): the `win32-x64` values come from the
published tarball read on macOS, so a staged `opencode.exe --version` must be confirmed on Windows
before release.

## Pin the Computer Use driver

`native-runtime.lock.json` pins `cua-driver`, the third-party binary that gives every provider
Computer Use, by release tag, asset SHA-256, and one SHA-256 for each file OpenBot ships. Unlike the
provider CLIs, the driver is packaged rather than downloaded on demand, so the release carries it and
the user installs nothing.

```bash
bun run pin:cua-driver 0.34.0
```

The script downloads all three `-binary` release assets, hashes each shipped file, and refuses a
release that renamed an asset or dropped a file. It prints the block for review instead of rewriting
the lock, so paste it over the `cuaDriver` entry. Use the versioned `cua-driver-rs-v*` tags; the
`nightly-cua-driver-rs-v*` tags are rebuilt daily and are not a pin.

`bun run prepare:cua-driver` then writes `build/cua-driver/<platform>/<arch>` from the pin, verifying
every digest before and after it installs, and `electron-builder.yml` copies that directory to
`resources/cua-driver/<platform>/<arch>`. Every `package`, `package:*`, `dist:*` and `dist:release`
run does this first. Each installer carries only its own target's driver, and the package verifiers
check both that the driver is present and that no other platform's is. The macOS release job calls
`electron-builder` directly rather than through `dist:mac`, so it installs the driver in its own
`Install and verify native runtimes` step; the Windows and Linux jobs get it from `dist:win` and
`dist:linux`.

On macOS the driver arrives signed by Cua AI with the hardened runtime, a secure timestamp, and the
Automation entitlement. `mac.signIgnore` keeps that signature: re-signing it under OpenBot's
inherited entitlements would drop the entitlement and break the driver's Automation route.
Notarization accepts a nested binary signed by another Developer ID team, and
`verify-macos-package.ts` fails if the Cua AI authority or the hardened runtime flag is ever lost.

## Pin the Bun tool runtime

`native-runtime.lock.json` also pins Bun, which is not a provider CLI: it is the runtime a STDIO MCP
server is started with on a computer that has no Node, and the staged layout puts a second name
`bunx` beside it so that `npx -y <package>` has something to answer it. The pin has its own script
for the same reason OpenCode does - the version, three platform packages, and the MIT license have
to agree:

```bash
bun run pin:bun-runtime         # the newest published release
bun run pin:bun-runtime 1.4.2   # one exact version
```

It works like the OpenCode script: it downloads all three platform tarballs, checks
`package/package.json` against the registry metadata, hashes the extracted binary and
`LICENSE.md`, runs `--version` on the target that matches the host, and prints the block for review
instead of rewriting the lock. Paste it over the `bun` entry and re-run it with that exact version
to get `already pins Bun <version>`.

The x64 entries are the `baseline` builds. Bun's plain x64 build needs AVX2 and answers a spawn on
an older machine with an illegal instruction and no message, which would reach the user as an MCP
server that never starts.

Move this pin at release preparation, with the release-upgrade-safety audit, and not on a schedule:
a pinned runtime is OpenBot's supply chain, and a Bun security release only reaches users through an
OpenBot release. One reviewed commit per release.

## Release notes

`CHANGELOG.md` is the text of the `/changelog` page on the public site. Each pull request writes its
notes in its own file, `changelog.d/<branch>.md` with `-` for `/`, so two pull requests never change
the same lines. The version bump moves the items of every file into `CHANGELOG.md`, in the order
that the pull requests merged, and deletes the files. Items that are still under `## [Unreleased]`
in `CHANGELOG.md` go first.

- Put each change that a user can see in the file, in one of these groups:
  `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security`.
- Write one `- ` item for each change, for a user and not for a developer. Say what changed. For a
  fix, say what happened before.
- Write a step that the user must do after the upgrade as a bold sentence that ends with a full
  stop, for example `**Sign in again after you upgrade.**`. The page shows these items under "Action
  needed after you upgrade". Do not use bold for other sentences.

The iPhone app has its own versions and its own notes, in the Mobile tab of `/changelog`. Write the
notes of a change to the iPhone app in `apps/mobile/changelog.d/<branch>.md`, with the same rules.
A change to the desktop app or the web client and the iPhone app gets one file in each folder.
`bun run mobile:release:patch`, `mobile:release:minor` and `mobile:release:major` move these files
into `apps/mobile/CHANGELOG.md` and set the version in `apps/mobile/app.json`,
`apps/mobile/package.json` and the copy of it in `bun.lock`. The pre-commit hook checks the new section when a commit changes the
`app.json` version. The new section is `## [x.y.z] - In review`, and `/changelog` does not show it
until the store makes the build available. Then `bun run mobile:release:published` writes the date.

`scripts/check-release-notes.ts` stops a release when the section is missing, empty or appears two
times, or when it has an unknown group, a group with no items, an item with no text or outside a
group, a placeholder such as `TODO`, or a heading with no real date. These steps run it:

- `bun run release:patch`, `release:minor` and `release:major` check the new section before they
  write it. They stop, and delete no file, when a line is not in an item.
- The pre-commit hook checks each staged `changelog.d` file with `--fragments`, and the staged
  `CHANGELOG.md` when a commit changes the `package.json` version.
- The `Changelog` workflow checks each `changelog.d` file. It fails a pull request that adds no
  `changelog.d` file and does not change `CHANGELOG.md`, unless the pull request has the
  `no-changelog` label. Use the label when a user sees no change.
- `bun run release:preflight` and the tag workflow check the section of the `package.json` version.

## Publish a version

Start from a clean, up-to-date `main` branch. For the first release, `package.json` and
`CHANGELOG.md` are already prepared as `0.1.0`; after CI passes, create its annotated tag directly:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "OpenBot v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

For later releases, the release notes are in `changelog.d/`. Choose the appropriate semantic version
bump:

```bash
bun run release:patch
# or: bun run release:minor
# or: bun run release:major
```

The command updates `package.json`, moves the `changelog.d` items and the items under `Unreleased`
under the new dated version heading, and deletes the `changelog.d` files. Review and publish that
preparation before creating the tag:

```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md changelog.d
git commit -m "release: prepare vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
bun run release:preflight
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "OpenBot vX.Y.Z"
# When Signal changed since the previous tag, deploy and check Signal from
# vX.Y.Z now (preflight item 16). Push the tag only after that.
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Pushing the version tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
The tag workflow starts only after `https://openbot.run/join` and the Apple association file return
direct `200` responses with the required security headers, MIME type, app IDs, and paths: `/join`
for the desktop app, and `/join` and `/agents/*` for the mobile app.

The workflow:

1. verifies the tag matches `package.json`;
2. installs and verifies the pinned remote desktop runtime without CMake or Cargo;
3. runs the complete offline repository check;
4. builds signed and notarized ARM64 DMG and ZIP artifacts plus a separately signed/notarized Host PKG on a GitHub Apple silicon runner,
   and signed and notarized x64 DMG and ZIP artifacts on a GitHub Intel runner (`macos-15-intel`). Each
   architecture builds on its own runner, because the voice runtime and the remote desktop runtime
   are prepared for the architecture of the build machine. The Host PKG is ARM64 only;
   when `hdiutil create` fails with "Device not configured" or "Resource busy", it builds again,
   up to 3 attempts, because that runner error is not caused by the app;
5. builds a signed Windows x64 NSIS installer on a GitHub Windows runner (unsigned in a dry run);
6. builds unsigned Linux x64 and arm64 AppImages on GitHub Ubuntu 24.04 runners of each architecture,
   with the launch check under `xvfb-run`;
7. verifies all three unpacked applications, update metadata, included runtimes, provider control
   artifacts, licenses, checksums, platform signing contracts, launch behavior, and update artifact
   size limits;
8. generates SPDX SBOMs and GitHub build-provenance attestations for all three platforms;
9. publishes one non-draft GitHub Release only after all platform jobs pass. It joins the ARM64 and
   x64 `latest-mac.yml` files with `scripts/merge-mac-update-manifests.ts`: electron-updater selects
   the ZIP whose name contains `arm64` on Apple silicon and the other ZIP on Intel.
10. builds a Docker image (`docker/Dockerfile`) from each Linux AppImage on a runner of that
    architecture, after it checks the AppImage against its `SHA256SUMS` file. It starts each image
    with `docker/seccomp.json`, waits for `openbot status`, and stops it, which must exit with 0;
11. after the GitHub Release is published, pushes both images to `ghcr.io/nightly-labs/openbot`
    with the tags `<version>-amd64` and `<version>-arm64`, joins them under `<version>`, `v<version>`,
    `latest` and `sha-<commit>`, and attests the build provenance of that image. It then checks
    anonymous access to both architectures. See [Docker](docker.md).

Users can verify a downloaded artifact with
`gh attestation verify <file> --repo nightly-labs/openbot`.

Before a tag, run the release path without publishing:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml --ref <branch> -f mode=dry-run
```

The dry run runs the tag validation (without the tag and `main` checks), the Windows, Linux and
Docker builds, and all their verification steps. It does not run the macOS job or the publish jobs,
and it makes no attestation: the macOS job needs the `release` secrets, which only tag runs receive,
and an attestation of this public repository is a public Sigstore record. Use `-f mode=host-signing` on a
tag ref to check the macOS Host signing keychain, and `-f mode=windows-signing` on a tag ref to check
Windows signing. `--ref` selects the workflow and the overlay, so the tag must point to the commit
to test. Use a temporary `v0.0.0-*` tag. It matches the `release` environment policy. Its push
starts a release run, but `Validate release tag` stops that run, because the tag never matches the
`package.json` version:

```sh
git tag v0.0.0-windows-signing-test <commit>
git push origin v0.0.0-windows-signing-test

It logs in to Azure, then signs a throwaway executable once immediately and once 20 minutes later,
the delay between login and signing in a release build. It uploads and publishes nothing. Run it once
after a change to the Azure setup or to `electron-builder.windows-signing.yml`, before the next tag.

Installed OpenBot builds check for updates shortly after launch and every four minutes. New versions
download automatically while **Automatically download updates** is on, which is the default and is
persisted per user in `openbot-update-preference-v1.json`; with the setting off, a download starts
only on a user action. The account popover shows the current state and lets the user download an
available version, then restart into it. The restart action appears as
soon as the download completes, and no platform installs without that
explicit action, because `autoInstallOnAppQuit` stays off so shutdown preparation always runs. Every
stage the user waits on is bounded by a timeout and recorded in `logs/update/update.log`, so a failed
check, download, or restart reports an actionable error and can be retried in place.

The voice runtime (the sherpa-onnx N-API addon and ONNX Runtime, from the pinned `sherpa-onnx-*`
npm packages) is part of the macOS and Windows applications, in `voice/runtime`. Linux ships no voice
runtime and no remote desktop runtime, so voice prompts and remote desktop report themselves as
unavailable there. The NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 int8 model is not part of an application or update
artifact. OpenBot downloads its four pinned files on first voice use, checks the size and SHA-256 of
each, and keeps the verified files in `runtimes/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8` in the user data directory
for later offline use. At startup, a packaged application removes the old `runtimes/whisper`
directory if it exists.

The release workflow stops if the macOS update ZIP, the Windows NSIS installer, or the Linux AppImage
is larger than 700 MiB, or if the DMG is larger than 750 MiB. It also stops if update metadata has a wrong size or SHA-512, if
the voice model is present, or if the application contains a second native Claude runtime.

If a release is bad, publish a newer patch version. Do not replace an already published version with
different binaries.

Before working this checklist, audit the changes since the last released tag with the
`.agents/skills/release-upgrade-safety/` skill: it covers the upgrade and data-loss hazards an
installed user cannot undo — the in-place database migration, the `userData` files nothing backs up,
the frozen Team API adapters, and the D1 migrations that race their own deploy.

## Preflight checklist

Before creating the first tag or any later release:

0. run the Team API compatibility matrix for every protocol that remains in the adapter registry. The matrix must cover an older client with the new host, the new client with an older host, matching versions, no shared protocol, capability omission, unknown optional events, and malformed known events. Do not reduce this matrix because a protocol is old or because many application versions separate the peers. Confirm that each supported protocol still has unchanged client and host fixtures;

1. run `bun run release:preflight` and resolve every reported release-secret or repository gate;
2. confirm the `release` environment contains all eight macOS secrets above; Windows signs through
   the Azure federated credential and needs no secret; Linux remains unsigned;
3. confirm the production `/join` page and Apple association file pass the deployment checks in CI;
4. run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run check` from a clean clone;
5. run `bun run package:verify` on macOS; Windows and Linux packaging and launch verification run on
   the release runners;
6. confirm that the lock file contains all six provider artifacts, their download and install sizes,
   and that their install checks pass;
7. smoke-test sign-in/setup, chat streaming, queues, attachments, agent messaging, browser control,
   context compaction, and the update popover;
8. on macOS ARM64, macOS x64, Windows x64, and Linux x64, update from the last public version and confirm check,
   download, preparation, explicit restart, new version, local agents, conversations, and queues. A
   Linux build only auto-updates when it runs from the AppImage, which the runtime reports through
   `APPIMAGE`;
9. test first voice use, download progress, retry after a stopped download, transcription, and cached
   offline use;
10. build a signed and notarized canary and test an update from the official `0.1.21` application on
   macOS 26 with a separate `userData` directory;
11. confirm the canary update does not crash in `CFURLConnectionSynchronous`, preserves data, starts
    the new version, and can run three provider downloads with restricted memory;
12. on Windows 10 and 11 x64, confirm that normal exit, restart, and sign-out do not start NSIS, while
    `Restart and install` does start it;
13. on Ubuntu 24.04 x64 with the AppArmor profile from `build/linux/openbot.apparmor` installed,
    confirm the AppImage starts with the sandbox on, that `xdg-open 'openbot://join?...'` focuses the
    running application, that a provider downloads in-app, that the server rail is drawn, and that the
    microphone control is absent;
14. confirm `CHANGELOG.md` describes the version and the working tree is clean;
15. create and push the version commit, and create the tag locally, only after CI passes on `main`;
16. read the running Signal commit from `curl -fsS https://signal.openbot.run/health/live`. If it is
    missing or `unknown`, or if `git diff --quiet <running commit> <new tag> -- remote packages/contracts/src/signal-protocol`
    finds changes, deploy Signal from the local tag before you push the tag. Compare with the running
    commit, not with the previous tag: an earlier release can have left Signal behind. Pushing the tag starts the
    release workflow, and nothing in it waits for Signal. Use the Signal-only procedure in
    [remote-session-deployment.md](remote-session-deployment.md#deployment-procedure--requires-separate-approval);
    the `.agents/skills/signal-deploy/` skill adds the checks before and after it.
    Confirm that `curl -fsS https://signal.openbot.run/health/live` shows the tag commit. A client
    that needs a newer Signal fails until then: v0.33.0 shipped webhook routines while Signal was older
    than #1520, so every webhook route answered 404 (#1661);
17. push the tag.

The macOS ZIP must be smaller than 800,000,000 bytes and smaller than the official `0.1.21` ZIP.
Do not publish when either size gate fails, the `0.1.21` canary update crashes, or Windows starts NSIS
during shutdown or sign-out.

The unsigned local macOS package is a development artifact. It does not prove Gatekeeper,
notarization, or auto-update readiness. Those are proven only by the signed release workflow's
`codesign`, `spctl`, and `stapler` checks.

After publishing `v0.1.0`, keep one installed copy and use the first signed patch (`v0.1.1`) as the
end-to-end updater acceptance test: check, download, restart, and confirm the version changed without
losing local agents or queues. This cannot be proven with an unsigned development build because macOS
updaters require both versions to share a valid Developer ID signature.

## Managed-host release package

The normal DMG remains the desktop application. The optional Host PKG installs managed-host
infrastructure only. Both use the validated `v<VERSION>` tag and the exact same source commit.
The macOS job fails if Host compilation, signing, payload verification, notarization, stapling,
or checksum generation fails; it never publishes a release with the Host package silently omitted.

Expected macOS assets:

```text
OpenBot-<VERSION>-arm64.dmg
OpenBot-<VERSION>-arm64.zip
OpenBot-Host-<VERSION>-arm64.pkg
latest-mac.yml
SHA256SUMS-macos.txt
OpenBot-<VERSION>-macos.spdx.json
OpenBot-Host-<VERSION>-macos.spdx.json
OpenBot-<VERSION>-macos.sigstore.json
OpenBot-<VERSION>-x64.dmg
OpenBot-<VERSION>-x64.zip
SHA256SUMS-macos-x64.txt
OpenBot-<VERSION>-macos-x64.spdx.json
OpenBot-<VERSION>-macos-x64.sigstore.json
```

The macOS checksum file covers the DMG, ZIP, and Host PKG. The existing provenance step consumes
that file, so all three artifacts are attested against the same tag, commit, and release run.
The publish job downloads `release-macos` and `release-macos-x64` and publishes the PKG with the
other assets. `SHA256SUMS-macos-x64.txt` covers the x64 DMG and ZIP.
`latest-mac.yml` still describes only Electron application updates; a `.pkg` reference is rejected.

After verifying OpenBot.app, the macOS job:

1. runs native account tests without creating users;
2. imports the application and installer certificates into a temporary, isolated keychain;
3. compiles standalone ARM64 `host-manager` and `openbot-host` executables with Bun, and the native
   account helper with Swift; no target-machine runtime or compiler is required;
4. signs all executables with **Developer ID Application**, hardened runtime and timestamp, and
   checks their fixed identifiers and team `ZTRDTUL87R`;
5. creates the fixed root:wheel package payload and signs the PKG with **Developer ID Installer**;
6. expands it and rejects extra files, symlinks, unsafe modes/owners, version mismatches, changed
   installer scripts, unexpected destinations, or non-system dynamic runtime dependencies;
7. submits the PKG through `notarytool`, waits for `Accepted`, staples it, then requires successful
   `pkgutil --check-signature`, `spctl --assess --type install`, and `stapler validate`;
8. generates checksums and the Host payload SBOM, attests provenance, and uploads the PKG.

The Bun executables need only `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` for JavaScriptCore's ARM64 JIT.
The native account helper has no special entitlements. Library validation, executable-page
protection, and the hardened runtime remain enabled. CI launches the signed standalone binaries
with a system-only PATH and exercises a hot JavaScript loop before publication. Do not copy broad
example Bun entitlements that disable these protections. If the pinned Bun version cannot pass
these checks, stop the release and investigate; do not weaken the flags to obtain a signature.

The release keychain and imported `.p12` files are deleted at step exit. The installer identity is
mandatory and distinct from the application identity; add both new secrets before tagging. Never
publish an unsigned Host package. The test fixture package is temporary, unsigned, never installed,
and never uploaded as a release asset.

CI does not install the root daemon or create tenant accounts on the runner. Package expansion,
BOM ownership/mode verification, plist/signature checks, standalone smoke checks, and mocked CLI
checks run there. Actual signed PKG installation/upgrade, new-account login, private-home isolation,
and two-user Aqua relaunch remain the [target-host acceptance gate](multi-tenant-hosting.md#target-host-acceptance-required-before-paying-client-use).
No tenant-data backup is made. Infrastructure updates require administrator installation of a
newer signed Host PKG; the daemon never replaces itself.
