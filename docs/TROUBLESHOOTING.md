# Troubleshooting OpenBot

## OpenBot says agent CLI setup is required

Open Terminal and verify the CLI:

```bash
codex --version
```

If the command is missing, install Codex using the official installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Then run `codex login`, sign in with ChatGPT, fully quit OpenBot, and open it again.

You can use Claude instead. Verify and install Claude CLI:

```bash
claude --version
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude auth login
```

If Codex is installed in a non-standard location, launch OpenBot with `OPENBOT_CODEX_PATH` set to the
absolute Codex executable path.

For a non-standard Claude location, set `OPENBOT_CLAUDE_PATH` to the absolute Claude executable path.

## The Linux AppImage exits immediately

On Ubuntu 23.10 or newer and on Debian 13, unprivileged user namespaces are restricted by AppArmor.
The Electron sandbox is built on one, so OpenBot exits during launch and writes a message about the
SUID sandbox or a user namespace to the terminal.

Install the AppArmor profile that ships with OpenBot, then reload AppArmor:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 build/linux/openbot.apparmor /etc/apparmor.d/openbot
sudo systemctl reload apparmor
```

The same file is inside the AppImage at `resources/linux/openbot.apparmor`. The profile attaches to
the usual places to keep an AppImage; if yours is somewhere else, edit the path in the profile before
you install it.

Do not start OpenBot with `--no-sandbox`. It is not a supported workaround. The sandbox is the
boundary between a web renderer and the rest of your computer, and OpenBot gives its agents full
local access on the other side of it.

## Voice prompts or remote desktop are missing on Linux

The Linux build has no voice transcription runtime, so the microphone control is not drawn.

Remote desktop on Linux needs the x64 AppImage and an X11 session. Sunshine captures the X11 screen
and sends mouse and keyboard input through the XTest extension. Under Wayland, or with no `DISPLAY`,
remote desktop reports that it needs an X11 session. Log in with an Xorg session, or start OpenBot
under `xvfb-run` on a server. The arm64 AppImage does not include the runtime.

## Computer Use is unavailable

Computer Use needs the `cua-driver` binary. An installed release carries it, so the panel reporting
a missing driver means a development build, or a file that was removed. On macOS it also needs the
Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions; Windows and Linux ask for no permission, so there a
driver that answers is ready. OpenBot starts the driver itself; it does not bypass the macOS prompts.

If an installed release reports that the driver is missing, reinstall a complete OpenBot package,
then start OpenBot again. Keep your OpenBot data folder. A separate driver installation cannot
repair an installed release, because the application uses only its bundled driver.

In a development checkout, run `bun run prepare:cua-driver`, then press **Try again** in the panel.
This command writes the same pinned build the release ships.
`bun run cua-driver:doctor` reports which binary OpenBot would use, and `OPENBOT_CUA_DRIVER_PATH`
selects a different one. The installed application ignores that variable: it runs only the driver it
was released with.

On Linux the driver reads the desktop through AT-SPI, so it needs the session bus of the desktop it
is to drive. A daemon started from a container, from `runuser`, or as root against another user's
session finds an empty accessibility tree, and `get_window_state` reports `degraded`. X11 is the
driver's fully supported Linux session. On Wayland OpenBot starts the driver with
`CUA_DRIVER_RS_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1`; set that variable yourself to `0` if your compositor works better
through XWayland. Window rectangles under GNOME also need the driver's own `winrects@cua` shell
extension, which its installer refreshes but does not enable for you.

If the panel reports that permissions are needed, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and
grant both **Screen & System Audio Recording** and **Accessibility**, then press **Check again**. A
development build asks for the grants as **Electron**, not as OpenBot, because the development binary
is the responsible process. For the same reason a development grant does not carry over to an
installed release, and each build must be granted once.

## Computer Use is slow

A Computer Use step has two parts: the driver does the action, and then the model reads the result
and chooses the next action. While the driver works, the activity line in the chat shows **Using an
app on this computer…**. While the model works, it shows **Deciding the next step in the app…**.
When the agent writes its own progress note, the line shows that note instead. When the line stays
the same for 5 seconds, the time since it changed shows next to the text.

A driver call usually takes a few seconds or less. To see the time of each call, start OpenBot from
a terminal. Each driver call that takes 5 seconds or more shows in its output as `Computer Use
driver answered`, with the tool name and the milliseconds. A call that gets no answer before the
agent closes the connection shows as `Computer Use driver did not answer`. Set
`OPENBOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to show every call. The log does not contain what the agent typed.

Most of the time in a slow step is the model. Its time depends on the model and on the reasoning
effort in the agent settings: a high effort can use tens of seconds before each action. For
mechanical GUI tasks, select a lower effort or a faster model. Name the application and the action
in your request, for example "In Safari, open https://example.com", so the agent does not look for
the target first.

A step also gets slower as the conversation gets longer. The model reads the full conversation
before each action, and each window read stays in it. When the conversation fills the model's
context, the provider compacts it: it writes a summary, which can take minutes, and the chat
shows no action in that time. A new conversation for a new GUI task does not have this cost, and the
agent keeps its workspace. With OpenCode, OpenBot adds a JSON copy of each driver result
to the result text, because OpenCode shows the model only the text. The copy leaves out the element
list, because the tree in the text already names each element by its index.

## A chat is missing after an update

Do not follow the reset steps below. Your messages are stored in one SQLite file, nothing copies it
before an upgrade, and moving that folder puts the only copy out of reach.

Quit OpenBot and start it again first. On launch OpenBot gives a chat back to the agent it belongs to
when an agent and its chat lose track of each other, so a restart recovers most cases on its own.

If the chat is still missing, quit OpenBot and read the file directly. This reports chats that no
agent currently claims, and the number of messages waiting in each:

```sh
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenBot/openbot.db" \
  "SELECT t.thread_id, t.agent_id, (SELECT count(*) FROM projection_thread_messages m
     WHERE m.thread_id = t.thread_id) AS messages
   FROM projection_threads t
   LEFT JOIN projection_agents a ON a.agent_id = t.agent_id
   WHERE a.agent_id IS NULL;"
```

Any row means the messages are still on disk and are recoverable. Report the output with the details
below, and keep the folder where it is until then.

## OpenBot will not start and names a stored agent profile

The message reads `Stored agent profile <id> has an unreadable "<field>" value`. Your data is intact:
OpenBot stops before it writes anything, which is what keeps the profile as it is.

Do not follow the reset steps below, and do not move the folder. Install the current version first:
OpenBot now repairs a stored profile field it cannot read and keeps the agent, its chat and its
workspace, while a release from before that repair refuses to start over the same profile.

If the current version still stops, quit OpenBot and read the profile it names. On macOS:

```sh
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenBot/openbot.db" \
  "SELECT agent_json FROM projection_agents WHERE agent_id = '<id>';"
```

On Windows, the same file is at `%APPDATA%\OpenBot\openbot.db`.

Report the field the message names, together with the details below. The output holds your own file
paths, so review it before you publish it.

## A company firewall or proxy blocks OpenBot

Sign-in shows "A firewall or proxy on this network blocked OpenBot from reaching `<host>`" when a
network filter, such as Fortinet, answers in place of the OpenBot service. This occurs when the
filter shows a block page, or when it inspects TLS with a root certificate that the computer does
not trust.

OpenBot trusts the root certificates in the operating system store, as a browser does. If the
company installs its inspection certificate on the computer, OpenBot accepts it. Agent CLIs that
OpenBot starts, such as Codex and Claude, check certificates by their own rules. Do not turn off
certificate checks to work around a block.

Ask the network administrator to allow these hosts over HTTPS (TCP 443) and WebSocket:

| Host | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `api.openbot.run` | Accounts, sign-in, teams, and hosted servers |
| `signal.openbot.run` | Connection setup for teams and remote servers |
| `openbot.run` | Public site and images in invitation emails |
| `*.openbot.run` | Hosted servers and sites, and `analytics.openbot.run` |
| `github.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com` | App updates |

Teams and remote servers also send WebRTC traffic to the other device or to the TURN relay that
Signal names, on the UDP and TCP ports that it names. A filter that blocks WebRTC makes these
connections slow or stops them. Conversations stay on the computer; the [privacy policy](../PRIVACY.md) lists what each
host receives.

If the filter puts `openbot.run` in a blocked category, the administrator can ask the vendor to
review it. For Fortinet, use the FortiGuard web filter lookup.

## Reset OpenBot

Quit OpenBot before moving data. To reset application state and the shared browser profile while
keeping agent workspaces, move this folder somewhere safe:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot
```

To also reset agent workspaces, managed transfers, and downloads, move this folder as well:

```text
~/OpenBot
```

OpenBot creates fresh folders on the next launch. Review and back up their contents first. Do not
remove `~/.codex` or `~/.claude` unless you intentionally want to manage CLI login and history.

## Uninstall

Quit OpenBot. On macOS remove `OpenBot.app` from Applications; on Windows use the installer's
uninstaller; on Linux delete the AppImage, `~/.local/share/applications/openbot.desktop`,
`~/.local/share/icons/openbot.png`, and `/etc/apparmor.d/openbot` if you installed the profile. If
you also want to remove local OpenBot data, follow the reset steps above. Agent CLIs and their data
are independent and are not removed with OpenBot.

## Report a problem

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nightly-labs/openbot/issues) for reproducible bugs. Include
the OpenBot version, the operating system and its version, the hardware, the provider and CLI
version, and minimal reproduction steps. Never publish tokens, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, conversations, private files,
Electron user data, or full unreviewed diagnostics.
