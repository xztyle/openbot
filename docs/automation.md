# Local script runs

A script on the computer that runs OpenBot can run a routine of an agent and give it a payload. Use
this to wake an agent when work outside its turn ends: a build, a download, a long test run.

```sh
long-job; curl -sS -X POST "$(cat "$OPENBOT_AUTOMATION/url")/v1/agents/<agentId>/routines/<routineId>/run" \
  -H @"$OPENBOT_AUTOMATION/headers" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"payload":"long-job ended with code 0"}'
```

`$OPENBOT_AUTOMATION` is not set by OpenBot. It stands for the folder below.

## Turn it on

The setting is per agent and is off by default. Open the agent's settings and turn on
**Local scripts**. The setting is only on the computer that runs the agent: a joined server does not
show it, and an agent cannot turn it on for itself or for a teammate.

When the setting is on, each routine of the agent has **Copy run command**. It copies a `curl`
command on macOS and Linux and a PowerShell command on Windows. The agent also learns the command,
so it can start a long command in the background and ask to be woken when it ends.

## Files

While at least one agent allows local scripts, OpenBot listens on `127.0.0.1` on a free port and
writes three files in `<userData>/automation/`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` |
| `token` | The bearer token |
| `headers` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, for `curl -H @headers` |

The folder is `0700` and the files are `0600`, so only the same OS user can read them. OpenBot
makes a new token and a new port at each start. A command reads the files when it runs, so a
command that you copied before a restart still works. When the last agent turns the setting off, or
OpenBot quits, OpenBot stops listening and deletes the files.

`<userData>` is the OpenBot application data folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBot`
- Linux: `~/.config/OpenBot`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\OpenBot`

## Routes

Each request needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### `GET /v1/agents`

The agents that allow local scripts, with their routines:

```json
[{ "id": "agent-1", "name": "Ada", "routines": [{ "id": "routine-1", "name": "Wake", "active": false }] }]
```

### `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/routines/:routineId/run`

Body: `{ "payload"?: string }`, with `Content-Type: application/json`. The run starts the same way as
**Test run**, also for a paused routine. The payload goes after the routine's instruction, under the
heading `--- event from a local script ---`, with a line that tells the agent to read it as data,
not as instructions. The run history keeps it, so a run that a restart
interrupts sends it again.

Answer: `202 { "runId": string, "deliveryId": string | null }`. The delivery ID is `null` for a run that waits for a free place.

A run that a script starts can end without a message. Write `[[no-update]]` in the routine task as the
answer for "nothing needs me". If the agent then answers only that marker, the run leaves no message
and no notification. Without the marker in the task, the answer stays visible. A Test run always stays
visible. The same applies to a run that a webhook started.

A routine starts at most 20 runs an hour from scripts and webhooks together. A later event does not
start a run at once. It waits, and the waiting events go out as one run that has all of them, when
a place frees. A restart ends the wait, and each waiting run then starts on its own. The limit of 30
runs an hour for each agent stays as the hard limit.

`202` means that the run is in the queue, not that it ran. When the agent's provider account is at
its usage limit, the run waits in the queue, with its payload, and starts after the reset. A routine
set to skip at the limit drops the run instead, and its run history shows it as cancelled.

| Status | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | The body is not JSON, or `payload` is not a string. |
| 401 | The token is missing or wrong. |
| 403 | The request has an `Origin` header or a foreign `Host`, or the agent does not allow local scripts. |
| 404 | The agent or the routine does not exist. |
| 409 | The agent cannot take the run now, for example while it is being deleted. |
| 413 | The body is larger than 32 KiB, or the payload is longer than 4,000 characters. |
| 415 | `Content-Type` is not `application/json`. |
| 429 | The agent got 30 runs from local scripts in the last hour. |

## Windows

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri ((Get-Content -Raw "$env:APPDATA\OpenBot\automation\url").Trim() + '/v1/agents/<agentId>/routines/<routineId>/run') `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = 'Bearer ' + (Get-Content -Raw "$env:APPDATA\OpenBot\automation\token").Trim() } `
  -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{"payload":"long-job ended"}'
```

## Security

- The listener binds only `127.0.0.1`. Other computers cannot reach it.
- A request with an `Origin` header, or with a `Host` other than `127.0.0.1:<port>`, gets 403 before
  OpenBot reads the token. A web page cannot use it through DNS rebinding.
- The token is a secret: OpenBot redacts it from logs and never puts it in a prompt. The agent gets
  only the file paths.
- Do not put the token in a command's arguments, for example with `-H "Authorization: Bearer
  $(cat token)"`. On Linux, other users can read the arguments of a running process. Use
  `-H @headers`.
- OpenBot logs the agent and the routine of each run, never the payload.
- A process that runs as the same OS user can read the token. Turn the setting on only for agents
  that you want such processes to wake.
