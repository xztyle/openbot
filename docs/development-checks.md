# Development check design notes

These notes explain the checks referenced by [repository instructions](../AGENTS.md#checks).
Read the relevant section when changing CI, dependencies, or lint rules. Routine tasks use the
short command list in `AGENTS.md`.

## Check coverage

Full lint and typecheck read more than the changed files. A shared export can break desktop,
mobile, or a service outside the edited project. Lint uses
`biome check --max-diagnostics=none .`: the default diagnostic limit hides findings after the first
20 even though the reported total includes them. `bun run format` adds `--write` to the full scan;
this is why routine fixes target paths or use the staged-file hook.

The aggregate typecheck selects `typecheck:*`. Mobile was previously named only `mobile:typecheck`
and was omitted. It now has `typecheck:mobile`; the old name remains an alias for CI. Mobile uses
`@openbot/brand`, `@openbot/contracts`, and `@openbot/team-client`. Its Expo and Uniwind generation
writes ignored files before TypeScript runs.

Each `typecheck` script starts TypeScript through `node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc`, not a bare
`tsc`. `storybook-solidjs-vite` installs typescript@6 as `@typescript/old`, and bun links that
package's `tsc` into `node_modules/.bin` in place of the TypeScript 7 one. A bare `tsc` therefore
checks with TypeScript 6 without a warning; `scripts/dependency-catalog.test.ts` rejects one.

Signal had a similar gap: `remote:check` was its only entry point and also required Compose
validation. `typecheck:remote` and `test:remote` now run in CI. `remote:check:compose` validates both
Compose files with the Docker CLI; it does not need a daemon. `remote:check` remains the combined
local command.

`remote/api/tsconfig.json` also covers `remote/scripts/*.ts`. These scripts use Bun, while root
`scripts/**` and Electron main use Node types. Keep Bun types within the remote project rather than
adding Bun globals at the root. `remote/scripts/update.ts` drains and recreates the live coturn
container, so its type coverage matters.

`tsconfig.node.json` and `tsconfig.web.json` set `verbatimModuleSyntax`: a file compiles alone the
same way under `tsc` and the bundler, because a type-only import must say `import type`. It had no
findings when it was turned on. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is not on yet: it had 481 errors in 226
files of the projects that extend `tsconfig.base.json` on 2026-09-26. The type ratchet holds it to
those counts.

The Signal Dockerfile installs from a pruned checkout with one manifest copy per workspace.
CI does not build that image. `scripts/dependency-catalog.test.ts` checks that the copied manifests
cover the workspace dependency graph; keep that check when changing workspace dependencies.

`check:assets` reads `git ls-files` and fails on an image or video file outside the directories
listed in `scripts/check-image-assets.ts`. `AGENTS.md` does not permit pull request screenshots in
the repository, and a screenshot committed for a review stays in the history of `main`. The check
reads the whole tree, not only the pull request diff, so it gives the same result locally and in CI.

`check:doc-links` reads every tracked Markdown file. It fails on a relative link to a Markdown file
that does not exist, and on a `#anchor` that the target file has no heading or `<a id>` for. It makes
anchors the way GitHub does. It does not check web links or links to other file types. When you move
a section to another file, such as one in `docs/architecture/`, update each link to its anchor.

`src/backend/transfer-budget.test.ts` runs two turns with a fake provider. It counts the SQL
statements of each turn and of one conversation read, and the JSON bytes of that read and of the
events that one turn sends to the renderer. Each value has a hard cap about 30% above the value
measured when the cap was set. `src/main/team-api-transfer-budget.test.ts` runs the same two turns
and measures the response bytes of the Team API conversation routes at the current protocol. Each
test writes its values and caps to a file in `.openbot-build/transfer-budget/`, and the desktop
test jobs upload that directory. A red budget means a change made a turn or a read do more work:
make the change cheaper, or raise the cap and give the reason in the pull request.

After CI completes for a pull request, `.github/workflows/budget-report.yml` adds one comment that
compares these values with the reports of the last green `main` CI run
(`scripts/transfer-budget-report.ts`). It runs from `main` and reads the pull request reports only
as data, so it can write the comment without running pull request code.

The pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `check:staged`, then `check:ui` and
`scripts/staged-typecheck.ts`. The last two run only when the commit stages code, style, GritQL,
`tsconfig*.json`, `package.json`, `biome.json`, `apps/mobile/app.json` or `bun.lock` files, so a commit
of only text or data JSON is fast.

`scripts/staged-typecheck.ts` reads the root `typecheck:*` scripts and selects each project that can
see a staged file: the file is under a fixed part of the project's tsconfig `include`, in its
workspace package, in a workspace package that it depends on (also through other workspace
packages), or in a folder that it imports through a relative path. That last list is in the script:
`scripts` imports mobile and account Worker modules, the account Worker imports the site router, a
renderer story imports a preload helper, and `.storybook/preview.tsx` imports the renderer.
A root `tsconfig*.json`, `package.json` or `bun.lock` selects all projects. A mobile codegen input,
such as `app.json` or the brand CSS, selects mobile. `biome.json` and GritQL files select no project:
TypeScript does not read them. The script runs the projects one at a time and reports each one that
fails. `--dry-run` prints each selected script with the path that selected it; paths after the flag
replace the index. A JSON file that a module imports, such as a Team API fixture, does not start a
type check in the hook; CI checks it.

`apps/mobile` `typecheck` calls `scripts/mobile-codegen.ts`. It runs `codegen` only when a hash of
the codegen inputs and of the route file names differs from `.expo/codegen-inputs.sha256`, or when
an output is missing. File times do not decide: a checkout changes them, and Uniwind does not write a
file whose content is the same.

In CI, `check:desktop:static` (the UI check, lint, desktop typecheck, build and preload check) takes
about a minute, and each other typecheck takes a few seconds. When `openbot-database-schema.ts`, `channel-schema.ts`, `mcp-schema.ts`, the parity test or
`openbot-database-schema-history.json` is staged, the hook also runs `src/backend/openbot-database-schema-parity.test.ts`.

`check:staged` lets Biome fix the working-tree copy of each staged file, and the hook then stages
those files again. It stages again only the files that have no unstaged changes; otherwise the commit
would also take the author's unstaged edits. When Biome changes a file that is only partly staged,
the hook stops the commit and names the file. `scripts/pre-commit-hook.test.ts` covers the three cases.

One project typecheck, such as `typecheck:node` or `typecheck:renderer`, takes under 10 seconds and
less than 1.5 GB of memory. The load that the check rules prevent comes from the aggregate command,
which starts all projects at the same time. The hook used it until it selected projects: about
33 CPU-seconds and 8 GB of memory for each commit of code.

The source of truth for CI is [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
Its main jobs are:

| Job | Runner | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run knip:check`, `bun run check:assets`, `bun run check:doc-links`, `bun run check:desktop:static`, then `bun run i18n:check` and `bun run types:ratchet` in parallel |
| Browser smoke | `ubuntu-latest` | `xvfb-run -a bun run test:browser` |
| Tests (desktop 1/2, 2/2) | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run test:desktop -- --shard=<n>/2` |
| Tests (sites) | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run test:sites` |
| Tests (remote) | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run test:remote` |
| Surfaces | `ubuntu-latest` | Parallel groups described below, then `bun run remote:check:compose` |
| API | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run check:api`, then, for a pull request from this repository, upload `apps/auth-api/dist` |
| Storybook build | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run build-storybook` |

CI uses native GitHub Actions `parallel` groups. Each group waits for all its steps and fails
if a step fails. The steps have separate logs. The groups run in this order:

- `Check` completes `check:desktop:static` before it starts translation checks and the TypeScript
  ratchet together. Both retain the `CODE` condition, so Markdown-only changes run only the link
  check after setup. The desktop build still completes before `verify:preload`.
- `Browser smoke` completes checkout, then runs `Set up Bun` and virtual-display installation
  together. The smoke test starts only after both succeed.
- `Surfaces` completes setup, then runs three groups: `mobile:typecheck` with
  `typecheck:team-client`; `typecheck:sites` with `typecheck:remote`; and `typecheck:logging`,
  `typecheck:telemetry`, `typecheck:user-errors`, and `typecheck:i18n`. Each command uses `bun run`
  in its own step. Mobile generation stays inside `mobile:typecheck`. Compose validation starts
  after all groups succeed.

The desktop test shards keep separate runners. The API checks, artifact uploads, and production
deployment dependencies keep their existing order. Local commands do not change. Compare job
times on GitHub before claiming a time reduction; parallel steps share the runner's resources.

`check:api` ends with `api:build:check`, which is the preview build of the Worker, so the API job
uploads that build as the `cloudflare-preview` artifact. The job has no secrets. After the CI run completes, the trusted
[cloudflare-preview.yml](../.github/workflows/cloudflare-preview.yml) workflow runs its `main`
version with the preview deploy token. It skips a closed pull request, a newer commit, and a fork. It
builds the `main` Worker config, and `scripts/check-preview-worker-config.ts` stops the upload when
the pull request's generated `wrangler.json` differs from it in anything but the code entry and the
compatibility settings. Thus a pull request that changes the preview Worker name, bindings, vars, or
routes gets no preview. A change to `cloudflare-preview.yml` takes effect only after it merges.

All of these jobs gate Cloudflare production deployment on `main`. Surfaces was previously missing from
that dependency list, which allowed deployment despite a failed mobile or remote check.
These long suites belong in CI; local desktop runs can reach their time limits under load.

The `Detect changed areas` job lets a pull request skip the lanes it cannot affect. It compares the
merge commit with its first parent and first removes Markdown that no build or test reads: `docs/`,
`plans/` and `changelog.d/` Markdown, every `AGENTS.md`, and the root Markdown files except
`CHANGELOG.md`, which the API bundles. Markdown under `resources/` is not removed either, because the
renderer bundles it. Then it selects the lanes:

| Lane | Jobs | Runs when a changed path is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | Check, Tests (desktop) | anything that is left |
| `docs` | Check, with only `check:doc-links` when `code` is off | any Markdown file, before the removal above, or `scripts/check-doc-links.ts` |
| `desktop` | Browser smoke | outside `apps/auth-api`, `apps/mobile`, `apps/site-router`, `remote` and `docker` |
| `api` | API | in `apps/auth-api`, `apps/site-router`, `src/renderer` or `resources`, or a `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `sites` | Tests (sites) | in `apps/site-router` |
| `remote` | Tests (remote) | in `remote` or `scripts` |
| `storybook` | Storybook build | in `src`, `apps/auth-api`, `.storybook`, `resources`, `marketplace` or `build` |
| `surfaces` | Surfaces | in `apps/mobile`, `apps/site-router`, `remote` or `scripts` |

A path every workspace reads (`package.json`, `bun.lock`, `tsconfig*.json`, `biome.json`,
`.github/`, `packages/`, `tools/`, `patches/`, `vendor/`) runs every lane. `code` runs for a
mobile-only pull request: the desktop test run holds the mobile unit tests, desktop tests read
mobile, API and remote files, and lint and knip cover every workspace. The API Worker bundles the
renderer preview and web client and imports `apps/site-router/src`, so `api` reads them. A push to
`main` and a manual run always run every lane, because a skipped need would skip
`deploy-production`. When a lane reads another directory, add it to that lane's pattern in the
`detect` job. When in doubt, let the lane run.

`All required checks pass` needs every other check job and fails when one of them failed or was
cancelled; a skipped lane counts as a pass. Add a new lane to its `needs` list. Branch protection on
`main` requires only `Check`, not this job. A skipped required check counts as passed, so `Check`
runs when `detect` did not succeed, and skips only when `detect` found no code change and no Markdown
change. A Markdown-only change runs only its link check. The list of
changed paths uses `git diff --no-renames`: a moved file then lists its old path as well, so a move
of a file that a lane reads into `docs/` still runs the lane.

`verify:preload` reads `out/preload` after the build. TypeScript checks the preload source, but
the renderer gets the bundle. The script runs each bundle in a `node:vm` context with a fake
Electron and checks that `window.openbot` has exactly one function for each endpoint that
`IPC_ENDPOINTS` names, and that each function uses the channel of its endpoint. It also rejects
`import()` and a `require` of a module that a sandboxed preload cannot load. It takes less than one
second.

`bun run check:desktop` still runs everything: it is `check:desktop:static`, which holds the UI
check, the lint, the desktop typecheck, the build and `verify:preload`, followed by the browser
smoke test. CI is
the only caller that splits them. The smoke test starts the real Electron binary, so it runs under
xvfb on Ubuntu rather than on a macOS runner, and reads nothing the build writes, so the order
between the halves is free. `release.yml` keeps the whole of `check:desktop` on one macOS runner,
where it checks the machine that builds the release.

`bun run knip:check` fails on unused files, unused exports and exported types, unused or unlisted
dependencies, unresolved imports and unlisted binaries in every workspace. It takes about 6 seconds. `knip.config.ts` names the entry
points that knip cannot find by itself: the electron-vite inputs, the modules that the renderer HTML
pages load, the Metro shims, and every command in `scripts/`. Each ignore entry states its reason.
Stylesheets go through a small compiler so that `@import "<package>"` counts as a use. The frozen
Team API protocol files (`packages/contracts/src/team-protocol/v*.ts` and `*-v*.ts`) are exempt
from the export checks: a released codec keeps its full API. When knip names an unused export,
remove the `export` keyword, then delete the code if `tsc` or Biome reports it unused.
`bunx knip --fix --fix-type exports,types` removes the keywords; check its diff, because it can
break a destructured export.

`setup-bun` installs with the frozen lockfile without a GitHub Actions cache for the Bun package
store. In CI run 37915311865, restoring the 996 MB store took 23 seconds before installation.
The action keeps Bun binary caching and Node tool-cache support. Its `frozen`, `ignore-scripts`,
and `none` install modes do not change. Compare setup time and total job time when measuring this
change; removing the restore also requires fresh package downloads on a new runner.
The Electron download is
deliberately not cached: `install-electron` takes 2.6s on a runner, and a measured cache hit
restored 123 MB in 4.4s and left `bun install` at 29.9s against 29.0s with no cache at all.

## Focused tests

`bun run test:changed` is `vitest run --changed origin/main --maxWorkers=1`. First it runs
`git merge-base origin/main HEAD`, and stops with an error when `origin/main` or a common commit is
missing. Without this guard, Vitest ignores the failed `git diff`, finds no test files and exits
with code 0, so a broken test would pass. Vitest takes the files
in `git diff origin/main...HEAD`, the staged files, and the unstaged and untracked files. Then it
runs each test file whose import graph contains one of them. It uses the root `vitest.config.ts`,
so each file goes to its usual project (`node`, `renderer` or `mobile-ui`) and environment. When
no test imports a changed file, it finds no test files and exits with code 0. Fetch `origin/main`
first if it is old: an old base selects tests for changes that are already on `main`.

`bun run test:related -- <source>...` is `vitest related --run --maxWorkers=1`. It runs the test
files that import the named source files, with no Git query.

A change to `vitest.config.ts`, a setup file or `package.json` selects no test. The root config
sets `forceRerunTriggers: []`. The Vitest default (`**/package.json/**`,
`**/{vitest,vite}.config.*/**`) selects every test for such a change, but only when the checkout
path has no dot directory: `**` does not match a dot directory such as `.t3` or `.claude`. A full
run on one worker is not a focused check. A setup file is not in a test's import graph. After such
a change, run the test files that it can affect with
`bun run test:desktop -- <path>`.

A shared module can have many dependents. For example, `packages/ui/src/digit-roll.ts` selects 16
files, including the `App.*.test.tsx` files. Do a list first to see the set without a run:
`bun x vitest list --filesOnly --changed origin/main`.

## Test environment guard

`tools/vitest/hermetic-setup.ts` is the first setup file of the `node` and `renderer` projects, so it
runs before each test file imports anything. It deletes credential-shaped variables (`*_API_KEY`,
`*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_*`, `OPENAI_*`, `OPENROUTER_*`,
`XAI_*`, `GEMINI_*`, `AWS_*`), the directory overrides `CODEX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `XDG_*`,
and `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`. It sets `TZ=UTC` and `LANG=C.UTF-8`, and points `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`,
`APPDATA` and `LOCALAPPDATA` at a temporary directory for the file, which it removes after the file. The `renderer` project runs
files in worker threads, and a thread's `process.env` does not reach the native `homedir()`, so
`tools/vitest/hermetic-global-setup.ts` also moves `HOME` in the main process before the threads
start.

A key in the developer's shell could otherwise let a fake-provider test reach a real provider, and
every profile path (`~/OpenBot`, the app data directory) comes from `homedir()`, so a path bug could
write into the developer's own conversations. A test that needs a token or a directory sets it
itself. `tools/vitest/hermetic-environment.test.ts` and `tools/vitest/hermetic-home.dom.test.ts`
cover the guard.

## Why the jsdom projects use `vmThreads`

`test:desktop` is not slow because of test count. The 54 `renderer` files hold 732 of the 3401
tests and take three quarters of the run, and what cost the most was per-file setup rather than
anything in the tests: building a jsdom for each file was 61.8s of a 176.7s CI run. So the
`renderer` and `mobile-ui` projects use `pool: "vmThreads"`: one jsdom per worker, and a module
registry per file inside a VM context. That took the full suite from 118.7s to 92.6s locally.

The mounts themselves are not the cost, which is worth recording because the file sizes suggest
otherwise. Measured on one worker: `installOpenbotStub()` is 0.4ms, `AppProviders` with a probe
under it is 4.3ms, and a full `<App />` is 21.8ms, of which the view tree is 17.4ms. Dividing a
file's total time by its render count attributes the whole test to the mount and overstates it by
more than twenty times. Two other theories also measured close to nothing: the 50ms `waitFor` poll
interval is worth 9% on the worst file, because `waitFor` runs its callback once before it polls
and the condition is usually already true.

Isolation is the reason that pool was chosen over the faster `isolate: false`. The renderer files
share module-level store state, so without a per-file registry they pass only in the order vitest
happens to pick: `--sequence.shuffle.files` fails eight files under `isolate: false` and passes
under both `vmThreads` and the previous `forks` default. Use that flag when changing pool settings;
a green run in the default order proves nothing here.

The `node` project stays on isolated `forks`. Its files register IPC handlers and read
per-process globals, so they fail on `threads` whether or not isolation is on, and on `vmForks`
they fail on the filesystem; it also spends its time in the tests themselves rather than in
environment setup, so it has little to gain.

The worker count is left to vitest. It uses one less than the machine reports, and the runner
reports four vCPUs, so it runs three. Asking for a fourth is slower, not faster - 125.7s against
100.6s - because the workers then contend with the main process.

Compare pool settings with the summed `tests` phase divided by the wall clock, not the wall clock
alone. The wall clock is not usable evidence on its own: five runs of one commit, with nothing
changed between them, took 106.7s, 131.8s, 134.0s, 134.1s and 141.5s, a spread of 33%. Two runs of
a config change will therefore agree with almost any conclusion, and reading one slow run as a
worker-count change cost a wrong commit here.

The ratio is stable where the wall clock is not, because it says how many workers were actually
busy: it held between 1.99 and 2.08 across all seven runs on three workers, at durations from 100.6s
to 141.5s, and reached 2.64 on four. Use it, or repeat the run, before believing a pool change.

`deps.optimizer` is not enabled: it left `import` unchanged, at 26.1s against 26.2s, because that
phase is this repository's own module graph re-executing per file rather than dependency resolution.

### The `App.*.test.tsx` files are not at the wrong boundary

`App.read-state.test.tsx` is the largest test file in the repository, and moving its tests down to
`AppProviders` with no view was investigated and rejected. Of its 27 `render(() => <App />)` tests,
22 assert the rendered result - the `"1 new message"` badge, the `"New messages"` separator, or
`"Responded"` on a sidebar row - and the remaining five drive through the view, opening an agent or
switching servers by clicking it. None mounts the view without using it. Read state spans IPC, the
conversation store, window focus, which surface covers the conversation, and the badge, so the
application is the lowest boundary at which those tests hold together.

The five tests that genuinely need no view already use the `AppProviders` harness with a probe
underneath, and that is the pattern to follow for a new test that asserts only state. Reach for it
when a test asserts state; do not convert a test that asserts the badge into one that asserts a
probe, because the badge is the behaviour.

The development setup script checks Bun, migrates local D1, and creates missing local state in
`.openbot/dev-state.json`. The committed `apps/auth-api/.env.dev` is encrypted; a missing
development key does not block ordinary local setup. Existing state is reused. Values stored only
in the old generated `.env.dev` are reset on update.

## Lint and UI rules

Biome rejects these patterns in tests: `toHaveClass`, `toHaveStyle`, `getComputedStyle`,
`toContainElement`, `toHaveAttribute("title", …)`, `expect(x.innerHTML)`, DOM-tree walks,
`querySelector("svg" | "img")`, `document.activeElement`, snapshots, `*ByTestId` queries,
assertions reached through CSS classes, an awaited bare `setTimeout`, and `it.only`.
Use `toHaveFocus()` to name the element whose focus matters. Storybook stories are the place for
visual checks. Stories have no `play` functions: CI only builds Storybook, so a play function never
ran. `tools/ui-foundation/no-story-play.grit` rejects a new one in any `*.stories.tsx` file.

GritQL cannot connect a test query to the product's `data-testid` attribute. `check:ui` counts
renderer `data-testid` attributes separately, with a budget of zero.

`check:ui` also detects CSS classes that no component, story, or HTML entry point names. This found
about 1,400 lines of unused CSS. A dynamic `prefix-${value}` counts as a use only inside a class
attribute; the same template in an ID must not keep unrelated CSS alive.

Errors cover prohibited syntax. Warnings ask for judgment, such as an `object` parameter or a
module mock. Making correct boundary code worse to remove a warning defeats the check. A spy call
can synchronize an async test; the assertions after that wait must prove behavior.

Every GritQL rule has rejected examples marked `// flag` beside accepted examples. This matters
because a rule that matches nothing passes without enforcing anything. One rule failed to detect
`querySelector<HTMLElement>` until its fixture covered that spelling.

The UI fixtures have two trees. `renderer` breaks every check beside valid examples.
`renderer-clean` breaks none. Both are needed: a check that reports once per file can falsely reject
a valid example without changing the failure count in the first tree.

The shared UI Biome override also runs `tools/ui-foundation/no-desktop-preload.grit`.
It rejects direct `window.openbot` and `globalThis.openbot` access, including optional and
literal indexed forms. Browser APIs, comments, and string documentation remain valid.
Its positive and negative fixtures run in `scripts/ui-foundation-check.test.ts`.

### Promise rules

`nursery/noFloatingPromises` is an error in `biome.json`. Await a promise, or write `void` when the
call is fire-and-forget and the called function handles its own errors. Until 2026-10 a separate
`lint:ratchet` script held this rule to a per-file baseline. That cost a second full Biome pass in
CI, so the last findings were fixed and the script was removed.
`nursery/noMisusedPromises` was rejected: its 37 findings were all `if (cachedPromise)` presence
checks.

Biome reports every GritQL plugin under the one category `plugin`, so each plugin message starts
with `[<name>]`. A new GritQL rule must start with no findings.

### Type debt ratchet

`bun run types:ratchet` holds TypeScript options that are not on yet to a baseline. For each option
in `tools/typescript/type-baseline.json`, it runs `tsc` with the option on for every project that
extends `tsconfig.base.json` (listed in `scripts/type-ratchet.ts`), and compares the errors of each
file to the baseline. An error that two projects report counts once. `apps/mobile` extends the Expo
base config, so the ratchet does not check it. A higher count fails, so an option stops new debt
before the old debt is fixed. A lower count also fails until `--write` lowers the baseline: this
keeps the baseline tight. The script never raises a count; a higher count is a hand edit that a
reviewer sees. `--add=<option>` starts an option at its current counts. `scripts/debt-ratchet.ts`
holds these rules. The run takes about 4 seconds. When an option has no errors left, turn it on in
`tsconfig.base.json` and remove it from the baseline. Do not name the script `typecheck:*`:
`bun run typecheck` runs every script that matches that pattern.

### Plugin cost

Each GritQL plugin walks every file in its scope again. On 2026-10-06 the plugins used about 60 of
79 CPU-seconds of a full `biome lint .`. To measure one plugin, lint with a temporary config that
turns off the built-in rules and enables only that plugin, and subtract the time with no plugins.

- Check a cheap condition before a costly one. `no-hardcoded-ui-text` matched its long attribute
  regex on every JSX attribute: about 16 of its 23 CPU-seconds. It now checks the attribute name
  first.
- One snippet with a metavariable can cost less than one snippet per spelling.
  `Reflect.$method($args)` costs about half as much as two `Reflect.<method>($args)` snippets.
  `JsCallExpression(callee=...)` was faster still, but it also matched `Reflect.get?.()` and a call
  with type arguments, so it was rejected.
- Do not merge rules into one `or { ... }` file. A merged file of the 8 global rules cost 71
  CPU-seconds, against 24 for the separate files.
- Scope a plugin only to where its pattern can mean something. `no-collections-in-stores` runs on
  the SolidJS code only. The type rules stay global, because they apply to scripts and tests too.

Before you change a pattern for speed, show that the old and the new rule report the same
locations over the whole repository and on a file of edge cases.

### Removed rules and their limits

- `no-runtime-typeof` could not distinguish valid narrowing of `unknown` at a trust boundary from
  redundant checks of known values. All sixteen warnings were valid uses. The false positives
  made other warnings easier to overlook.
- `no-chained-type-assertions` repeated Biome's `noUnsafeTypeAssertion` and missed the
  unparenthesized `value as unknown as T` spelling. `noExplicitAny` already covers `any`.
- `no-shape-in-symbol-names` enforced a naming preference with a `const $name = $value` pattern.
  Each plugin traverses the files separately, and that common pattern cost more than the rest of
  the linter. Review can handle a naming decision without that cost.

A new rule must reject a specific syntax, leave valid neighboring code alone, and add coverage
that the existing checks do not provide.
