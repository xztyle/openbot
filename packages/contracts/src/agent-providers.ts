 * The coding agents OpenBot can drive, and everything about one that is the same wherever it is

 * literal chain, four renderer lists, a preload destructure that threw on an id it did not know,
 * an analytics regex - so adding one meant finding every copy, and missing one was silent.
 *
 * This is the list. A new provider is one row here plus one driver in
 * `src/backend/provider-drivers.ts`: the row carries the identity, the driver carries the
 * behaviour. Contracts owns the row because it is the only package the renderer, the main process,
 * the backend, the preload bridge, mobile and the account Worker all reach.
 *
 * Deliberately not here: the frozen Team API validators in `team-protocol/v1.ts` and the shipped
 * SQL `CHECK` lists, which are released vocabulary and must never move when this table moves; and
 * the per-provider argv, palette tokens and runtime-lock schemas, which belong to the driver, the
 * stylesheet and the lock file.
