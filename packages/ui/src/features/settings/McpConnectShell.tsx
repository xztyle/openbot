/**
 * What the connect dialogs share: the step between choosing an app and giving it to an agent.
 *
 * A server with a credential can fail for reasons the user can fix in the moment - a key pasted
 * short, a key for the wrong workspace, a server that is down. Installing first puts that failure
 * inside an agent's next answer, where it reads as the agent being broken. So a connect dialog
 * connects once, and only then does the caller offer the install.
 *
 * A server's ways in are not one dialog with a switch in it. Signing in at the server's own page and
 * pasting a key from its settings are different acts, so each has its own dialog: `McpSignInDialog`
 * and `McpKeyDialog`. What they share is here - the two marks, the header, the failure, the footer,
 * and the attempt behind them.
 *
 * A connection that worked is not reported here. The dialog closes on it and the page behind says
 * the app is connected: an answer the user has to dismiss would make the working case the slow one.
 * Only the states the user can act on stay - the wait, and the failure.
 *
 * Neither dialog saves. The connected configuration goes back through `onConnected`, so a credential
 * stays out of the store until a connection with it worked.
