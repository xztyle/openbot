/**
 * The step between pressing Disconnect and the plugin going.
 *
 * An install puts a plugin in two places - MCP servers on the host, skills on one agent - so a
 * disconnect takes things from two places as well. Neither is visible from the other, so the dialog
 * names every piece before it removes any of them: a user who reads "Disconnect Aave?" alone cannot
 * tell whether the skill they wrote instructions around is about to go with it.
 *
 * It lists only what is really there. A plugin the user installed before it published a second app,
 * or whose skill they already removed by hand, must not promise to remove something that is not
 * there to remove - and an agent whose skills this listing never reached is not named at all.
 *
 * `ConfirmDialog` rather than `Dialog`: this is a destructive decision with two answers, so Escape and
 * a click outside cancel it, and nothing about it is dismissible while the removal is running.
