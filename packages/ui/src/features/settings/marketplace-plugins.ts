/**
 * What a marketplace plugin looks like to the renderer, while the listing is still being designed.
 *
 * A plugin is one developer's bundle: the MCP server it publishes, shown as an **app**, the skills
 * that drive that server, and the listing text. Nothing here has a wire protocol yet - there is no
 * `skills:*` or `marketplace-agents:*` equivalent to answer these, so the types stay in the renderer
 * rather than in `@openbot/contracts/ipc`, where a shape can only be added once it is the shape the
 * main process really sends. `SkillCategory` is the one borrowed type: a plugin is filed under the
 * same categories the rest of the marketplace already offers.
