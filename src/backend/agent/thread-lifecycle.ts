  /**
   * What a stored manifest is compared against. The whole MCP set is folded in, because Codex
   * ignores a changed configuration on resume: an edited command, argument or credential has to
   * force a replacement session as surely as an added server. `mcpFingerprintValues` reduces the
   * secret values to a digest first, so the file this string is written to holds none of them.
   *
   * The names swept out of `~/.codex/config.toml` are folded in as well, and they are the reason
   * this is not OpenBot's set alone: a user who edits that file changes what the agent is given
   * while the stored set is untouched, and a loaded session would keep the old tools with the
   * panel saying otherwise.
   *
   * The managed tool runtimes are folded in too: a session started before Bun finished downloading
   * drops its `npx` servers, while the configured set alone reads unchanged. Without the runtimes
   * that session would resume forever without servers whose connection test passes by now.
   *
   * The adapter version rides along for the same reason: a session started before HTTP servers
   * reached the Codex payload holds the same stored set as today, so without it the old session
   * would resume forever with the servers it was given. Bump it when what Codex is sent changes.
   *
   * The profile the user edits is folded in as well. Codex keeps the developer instructions a
   * session was started with, so a session resumed after an edit goes on following the old
   * standing remit. The Access mode goes in for the same reason: the instructions say what the agent
   * may write. Memories stay out: the agent saves them during its own turns, and a new
   * session for each one would drop the provider history far too often.
   *
   * The agent environment goes in for the same reason as the MCP set: Codex keeps the configuration
   * of a resumed session. It holds paths only. It is added only when it is not empty, so a
   * computer with no GitHub connection keeps the fingerprints it had.
