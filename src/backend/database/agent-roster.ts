 * writer calls it from inside its own dispatch, passing the `db` that dispatch handed it.
 *
 * `hardDeleteAgent` is the one method here that erases history rather than projecting it. Each
 * receipt DELETE selects its command ids out of `orchestration_events`, so receipts must go before

   * with an agent missing leaves that agent's thread and every message in it behind.
