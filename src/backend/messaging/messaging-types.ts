// The seam between the platform-agnostic messaging core and one chat platform. A platform is one
// `MessagingDriver`: an adapter for its API and a transport for its inbound events. The OpenBot
// Slack app uses the Events API: Slack posts to Signal, Signal checks Slack's signature, and passes
// each request of a workspace linked to this host over the `MessagingIngress` socket, which the host
// opens. The OpenBot Discord app's Gateway connection is in Signal, which holds the bot token: Signal
// passes each guild's events over the same socket and makes the host's Discord calls. The OpenBot
// Telegram bot works the same way: Telegram posts each update to Signal, which passes it over the same
// socket, and the host calls the Bot API through Signal, which holds the bot token. No transport needs
// a public endpoint on the host.
