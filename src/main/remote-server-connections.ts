// These were four parallel `Map`s on the manager, keyed by the same ids and always written together.
// Every read had to remember each map's own default, forgetting one silently reported a server as

// why the old `#clearServerConnectionState` was a twenty-line ritual and is now `forget`.

// `remote-server-connection-status.ts` decides what a failure means; this file decides what is
// remembered about it. Keeping those apart is what lets the whole error table be tested without a
// manager, a socket or a disk.
