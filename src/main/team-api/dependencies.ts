// Every service arrives as a `Pick<>` of the real class. The point is not brevity: the Team API is

// caller can eventually reach, and widening one to the whole store is how something that was never
// meant to be remote becomes remote. The route modules under this directory each declare their own
// still-narrower `*RouteDependencies` over these.
