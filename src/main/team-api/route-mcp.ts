/**
 * The MCP servers of the machine that runs this host, managed from a joined server.
 *
 * `requireAdmin` runs on all five verbs, `list` included: a response carries every `env` value and
 * every header value the host holds, so reading is as privileged as writing. Saving an enabled
 * stdio configuration makes this machine spawn that process, and a test spawns one the caller has
 * only described. All of it was decided deliberately and is frozen by `mcp-v1`; narrowing any of it
 * needs a second capability string.
 *
 * Every route but `test` answers with the whole list, so a client never merges a partial result.
