/**
 * The scoped half of the conversation surface.
 *
 * The controller itself is created above the per-server scope (see
 * `app-providers.tsx`), because composer drafts, an in-flight voice send and a
 * queued-message edit are keyed by `serverId:agentId` and are expected to still be
 * there when the user comes back. What *is* scoped is the typing indicator and
 * the microphone: leaving the conversation - by opening Agent setup, a direct
 * message, or another server - has to release both, and this component unmounts
 * on exactly those transitions.
 *
 * On a server switch the typing indicator is released earlier still, in
 * `server-selection.tsx`, because by the time this unmounts main has already
 * moved its active server and the message would reach the wrong one. The call
 * here is then a no-op, and it is what covers the two transitions that stay
 * inside one server.
 *
 * `voiceDisposed` deliberately stays with the controller. It means "the app is
 * going away", not "this view went away", so a transcription that resolves after
 * the switch still lands on the server that started it. What replaces it for the
 * view's own lifetime is the scope guard in `ConversationView`, which keeps a
 * finished model download from opening the microphone for a conversation nobody
 * is looking at.
 *
 * `transcribing` is the one phase this does not release, because unlike the two
 * it does, it names work that is already running and that finishes into a draft
 * the user can still reach.
