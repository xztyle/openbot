 * Which messages a conversation shows after a page or a snapshot arrives.

 * arithmetic over whatever the caller stores rather than anything about read
 * state: `conversation.tsx` passes the stored message objects it already holds
 * so identity survives a merge, and the renderer only re-animates what is
 * genuinely new.
 *
 * Both functions exist because a conversation can be showing a window into a
 * longer history - older pages the user scrolled back to, or a page loaded
 * *around* a searched message - and main sends the tail of that history without
 * knowing what is on screen. Dropping the loaded prefix would scroll the user
 * away from what they were reading.

 * replaces the rest, so a message that the host no longer sends does not stay between the page's
